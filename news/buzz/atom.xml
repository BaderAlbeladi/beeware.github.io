&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/"&gt;PEP 738&lt;/a&gt;, formalizing the introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been formally accepted as a draft. We're now revising the draft following community feedback, in anticipation of submitting the PEP for formal approval in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a cross-platform Camera API to Toga. This API has been &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266"&gt;implemented for iOS and macOS&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2353"&gt;implementation for Android&lt;/a&gt; is in final review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2350"&gt;OptionContainer widget for Android&lt;/a&gt;. This now means that OptionContainer is available on every desktop and mobile platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added the ability to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2310"&gt;define a button with an Icon&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, we've added some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2348"&gt;major clarifications to the documentation about the difference between an Icon and an Image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2320"&gt;reworked the way that widget IDs are handled&lt;/a&gt;. This change was required due to a bug caused by the interaction of Python's garbage collector and the widget registry that prevented the re-use of widget IDs in some situations. The new implementation means that the widget registry behaves a lot more like a browser's DOM - a widget can only be discovered by ID when it is actually part of a widget layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added Briefcase support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1596"&gt;Python 3.12 on Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a mechanism for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1599"&gt;defining app permissions&lt;/a&gt; in your Briefcase project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added the ability for Android projects to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1610"&gt;declare the native Android libraries that they depend on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've been polishing the CPython patches necessary to support iOS and Android, in anticipation of submitting these patches upstream. To follow progress on this work, subscribe to the CPython tickets for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099"&gt;iOS support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052"&gt;Android support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, we'll be focusing on the iOS and Android patches to CPython, and the finalisation of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/"&gt;PEP 738&lt;/a&gt;. While we're waiting for CPython patches to be reviewed, we'll be looking into geolocation and mapping functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="want-to-get-involved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to get involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251"&gt;Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device sizes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780"&gt;Filter out a message generated after Xcode updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808"&gt;Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472"&gt;Print notarisation log failures when building macOS apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2301"&gt;Add an API to replace a child of a widget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305"&gt;Add an API to entirely replace the style of a widget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2307"&gt;Add the ability to define content when creating a window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html"&gt;guide on setting up a Briefcase development environment&lt;/a&gt;; but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on the ticket, or join us on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/bee/chat/"&gt;BeeWare Discord server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>2024Q1 Roadmap</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/2024q1-roadmap/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2024-01-10T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:399d0963-fe14-334f-9dd7-de0037271dac</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's the start of a new year, which means it's time to cast our minds forward to what BeeWare will bring in the coming year. 2023 saw some major milestones in stability and features; in 2024, we're going to build on that foundation. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q4-progress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q4 progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last quarter of 2024, we finally finished our audit and testing of Toga. We now have 100% branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends. We published &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.0/"&gt;Toga 0.4&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating all these changes - but it also meant that we were able to start adding &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; features to Toga, including an OptionContainer widget on iOS, and a draft of a Camera API for iOS and macOS. Toga's new test framework has made adding these new features must easier - for example, we were able to very rapidly identify (and resolve) gaps in functionality in the new iOS OptionContainer widget by running the existing test suite on a new implementation. We expect that this testing foundation will continue to serve us well as we add more features in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major development for the quarter was the start of the upstreaming process for Python on mobile platforms. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/"&gt;PEP730&lt;/a&gt;, proposing the addition of iOS to the Tier 3 supported list of CPython core, has been ratified by the steering council; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975"&gt;PEP738&lt;/a&gt;, proposing the same for Android, is in draft form. The first patch contributing towards iOS support has already landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q1-priorities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q1 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Q1 goals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete upstreaming iOS and Android support patches to CPython core&lt;/strong&gt;. We will finalise PEP738 and submit it for ratification; and we'll continue upstreaming the iOS and Android patches that we've been maintaining independently. This work has a hard deadline of May 7, as that is when Python 3.13.0b1 is planned, which is the feature cutoff for Python 3.13 development, so making sure we hit that deadline will be our main priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add OptionContainer for Android&lt;/strong&gt;. The implementation on iOS was relatively straightforward; we have no reason to believe that the Android implementation will be any more complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete the implementation of the Camera API&lt;/strong&gt;. We have a draft PR implementing a Camera API on macOS and iOS; we'll extend this API to Android, and complete the work on Briefcase that is needed to add support for permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add an API for geolocation, and a Map widget&lt;/strong&gt;. Geolocation is another major hardware features that is common on phones; we need to write a cross-platform layer for that hardware, plus add a native mapping widget to show off this capability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="longer-term-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer term goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of this year, you can expect to see three major themes in BeeWare development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we're going to continue to work upstreaming the work BeeWare has done in the mobile space into the wider CPython community. Once iOS and Android have been incorporated into CPython core, the focus will move to the packaging ecosystem. This means adding official support to upload iOS and Android packages to PyPI, and making it easy for third party projects to incorporate iOS and Android builds into their release processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we'll be increasing our efforts in education and training. BeeWare has a tutorial that we're extremely proud of - but there are many things we could add to that tutorial, and there are plenty of &amp;quot;How To&amp;quot; and topic guides that could be written for those who have finished the tutorial and want to try more advanced ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we'll continue to expand the capabilities of Toga. There are a handful of high profile widgets and capabilities that have been patiently waiting for us to have a stable platform to build on, and the spare capacity to implement them - features like a Radio Button widget, Trees and Tables on mobile platforms, a cross-platform Settings API, and cross-platform cloud file access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 promises to be a very exciting year for BeeWare. For the last 2 years, we've been focused on consolidating and stabilizing existing features. That work is coming to a close, which will allow us to turn our attention to building new features that show off the stable foundation we've built, and to providing the resources that will allow more users to try BeeWare for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/"&gt;PEP730&lt;/a&gt;, formalizing the introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218#issuecomment-1839333665"&gt;ratified by the CPython Steering Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112738"&gt;first patch to CPython that explicitly mentions iOS&lt;/a&gt; has been merged. This is a relatively minor change that is required for building cross-platform binary modules; we'll start submitting more substantial patches in the new year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/"&gt;PEP738&lt;/a&gt;, formalizing the introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been drafted, and is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975"&gt;currently under discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-15-0-1/"&gt;Chaquopy 15 was released&lt;/a&gt;, adding support for Python 3.12 on Android. This release also improves compatibility with Android Studio's transition away from Groovy, towards Kotlin for configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2259"&gt;implementation of OptionContainer was added for iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of improvements were made to image handling, including &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2263"&gt;optimizations when creating images from internal APIs&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2276"&gt;correction to flexible image resizing behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2291"&gt;long standing bug that would cause macOS tables to crash&lt;/a&gt; was resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2260"&gt;ability to define platform-specific icons&lt;/a&gt; was added to Toga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.1/"&gt;Toga 0.4.1 was released&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating the features and bug fixes from the last 2 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work has begun on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266"&gt;cross-platform Camera API&lt;/a&gt; . This currently works on iOS, with a draft implementation on macOS. Before this work can land, we need to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/547"&gt;add support in Briefcase for declaring permissions&lt;/a&gt;; a design for this has been proposed, and will be implemented early in the new year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we return from the end-of-year break, we'll be back into developing Toga. In the near future, you should see an OptionContainer on Android, and permission support in Briefcase; once that work is wrapped, we'll start looking at more more hardware APIs and missing widgets. You should also start to see more patches land in CPython to support iOS, and the finalisation of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/"&gt;PEP 738&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="want-to-get-involved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to get involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:&lt;/p&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>November 2023 Status Update</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/november-2023-status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2023-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:830b2374-c2e9-375c-83e9-015b21f3a1f7</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;November has been a month of focus on the code that enables us to run Python on iOS and Android - but there has still been some other high profile developments in other parts of BeeWare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/"&gt;PEP730&lt;/a&gt;, formalizing the introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218"&gt;submitted to the Python Steering Council for ratification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the major topics covered by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854"&gt;discussion about PEP730&lt;/a&gt; was the use of a deprecated compiler argument. This led to some re-examination of how CPython could be delivered on iOS without using that argument. As a result of that discussion, modifications to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191"&gt;use CPython as a dynamically loaded framework&lt;/a&gt; have been prepared. Although the original focus of this work was iOS, the same change will be also used for macOS - which means BeeWare no longer needs to compile a macOS support package (although we will still be lightly re-packaging the official CPython installer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified Toga's Image APIs so that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2231"&gt;Pillow images can be used as source data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2230"&gt;switched CI testing of Android apps to use a Linux machine&lt;/a&gt;. This wasn't previously possible, because Github didn't expose the necessary permissions in their Linux images; however, now that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible, our Android tests run up to 5 times faster, and are less likely to be held up in CI because of availability of macOS testing machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We corrected an issue on macOS where an OS-level setting controlling the use of tabs could &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2218"&gt;cause test failures in the Toga test suite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There have been some extended discussions and draft PRs related to Toga's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244"&gt;Application base class&lt;/a&gt;, and the addition of support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2238"&gt;status icons&lt;/a&gt;. These PRs are still in active development, but they will open up some interesting possibilities for Toga apps when they are completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1550"&gt;Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2229"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/387"&gt;Rubicon ObjC&lt;/a&gt; were all modified to use PEP621 metadata, removing the need for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;setup.cfg&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;setup.py&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;MANIFEST.in&lt;/tt&gt; files. As part of this change, we wrote a new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/setuptools_dynamic_dependencies"&gt;setuptools plugin&lt;/a&gt; to allow for dependencies to be dynamically defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified Briefcase so that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1552"&gt;answers to the new project wizard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1542"&gt;values for configuration settings when running commands&lt;/a&gt; can be overridden at the command line. This is mostly useful for testing purposes - it's now possible to generate a project and build it against a local template or support package build without needing to modify a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/tt&gt; file or override input handling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We refactored the new project wizard so that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1524"&gt;support for GUI toolkits is generated by an extensible plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Although we still ship with support for Toga, PySide, Pygame and PPB, this support is provided through a public interface, allowing other GUI toolkits to provide Briefcase with toolkit-specific modifications to the new project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We switched the default Android skin used by Briefcase from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1554"&gt;Pixel 3a device skin to the Pixel 7 skin&lt;/a&gt;. This is an entirely cosmetic change, but it does mean that screenshots will use a device that looks a little more modern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've made significant progress on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/milestone/3"&gt;modifications to Chaquopy to support CPython 3.12&lt;/a&gt;. This support will hopefully be released at the same time as the upcoming Android Studio &amp;quot;Hedgehog&amp;quot; release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've made significant progress on running CPython's unit test suite on iOS in a CI configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won't see as much progress as normal in December as a result of the end-of-year holidays. However, before we sign off for the year, we're hoping to start looking at OptionContainer on mobile platforms, and possibly start looking at Camera API support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="want-to-get-involved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to get involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We finally finished the Toga audit!!&lt;/em&gt;. We now have 100% test coverage of all Toga code on macOS, Windows, Linux/GTK, iOS and Android, with a consistent and fully documented API across all widgets. This has been a truly mammoth project, resolving countless bugs, adding dozens of new features, and improving platform support (especially on Windows and Android). Once we've finalised a couple of housekeeping issues, we will release Toga 0.4 incorporating all these changes. This will hopefully occur later this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We attended the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/2023-core-dev-sprint-in-brno-october-9-14/22868/21"&gt;Python Core Team Sprint&lt;/a&gt; at the RedHat offices in Brno, Czechia. As a result of this attendance, we produced a draft of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854"&gt;PEP 730&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first step towards formalizing support for iOS in CPython. An analogous Android PEP will be drafted once we've sorted out the process around the iOS PEP (as this is the first time a platform has gone through a formal process to be added to PEP 11's Tier 3 list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We reworked the build system for Apple support packages to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps"&gt;separate the compilation of dependencies&lt;/a&gt; (like BZip2 and OpenSSL) from the compilation of Python itself. These libraries are updated infrequently, and on a completely different cadence to CPython itself, so treating them as re-usable resources rather than something that needs to be compiled at the same time as Python will significantly improve CPython build times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.16/"&gt;Briefcase 0.3.16&lt;/a&gt;, formalizing our support for Python 3.12, and adding the new support for dynamic libraries on iOS. This release also formally downgrades our support for AppImage, following extended problems in supporting AppImage as an output format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/rubicon-objc/0.4.7/"&gt;Rubicon ObjC 0.4.7&lt;/a&gt;, formalising our support for Python 3.12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified Briefcase to ensure that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1475"&gt;macOS apps are universal by default&lt;/a&gt;, with an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1482"&gt;option to request a single-architecture build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1470"&gt;deep debug logging level&lt;/a&gt; to Briefcase, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1503"&gt;simplified the output of many other commands to ensure that important warnings aren't lost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2151"&gt;added support for Undo and Redo operations on macOS text widgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1399"&gt;added support for user-registered fonts on iOS and macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made some modifications to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2066"&gt;improve Toga's memory management when creating and destroying windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; finished the widget audit, we can finally release Toga 0.4, and start using the foundation that we've spent the last 12 months building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, we'll start the work of upstreaming iOS patches to CPython core. The PEP we've drafted is nearing a form where it can be submitted to the Steering Council for approval, but the drafting process has raised a couple of technical issues that need to be investigated. However, while we wait for formal acceptance of the PEP, we will continue working on building continuous integration for our iOS CPython builds, and begin preparing patches that can be merged into CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>2023Q4 Roadmap</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/2023q4-roadmap/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2023-10-03T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:0d2d2d1d-5d6f-3a5b-964d-149f3cfd8ccc</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As 2023 rolls to a close, BeeWare is more stable than ever, and is progressing well. However, there's still lots of work to be done. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q3-progress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q3 progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Q3, Toga testing continued to be a major focus area. We've completed testing on macOS, GTK and Linux; and testing on Windows and Android is nearing completion. Along the way, we've resolved dozens of bugs, discovered (and resolved) dozens more, and we've been able to eliminate a bunch of inconsistencies in naming and usage between widgets. We've also substantially improved the API documentation for widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in our monthly status reports, progress has been slower than expected because of the large number of edge cases and platform inconsistencies that we've found along the way. We're still a couple of weeks away from completing this work; but once it's all completed, we'll be able to publish a new version of Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quarter, we've also resolved a major known limitation on iOS - binary module packaging. We are now able to confirm that BeeWare is able to produce apps with dynamically loaded binary modules that the iOS App Store will accept through their review process. In the process of resolving this limitation, we've started developing a Forge for mobile packages, significantly improving the tooling for building binary wheels for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q4-priorities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q4 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Q4 goals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalize Toga's test suite&lt;/strong&gt;. For real this time - we'll have 100% branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends. Once we've released a version of Toga that includes all these fixes, we'll be able to publish a plan for the road to 1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python 3.12 support&lt;/strong&gt;. We're expecting Python 3.12.0 to drop any day. We've already done some preliminary work on Python 3.12 support, but we'll need to finalise that work once the final release is available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start upstreaming iOS and Android support to CPython&lt;/strong&gt;. This quarter, we'll begin the process of upstreaming the patches for iOS and Android support that we've been maintaining to CPython core, and developing the CI infrastructure to run CPython's full test suite on iOS and Android. The eventual goal is for iOS and Android to be Tier 3 supported platforms in Python 3.13. This will take a while to finalise, but we've got around 8 months until the feature freeze for Python 3.13, so we're confident we can make this happen. We're attending the CPython Core Team sprint this month to kick start this effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OptionContainer widget for iOS and Android&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the big gaps identified during the Toga audit was the lack of content navigation widgets on iOS and Android. This quarter, we're going to start addressing this gap, adding an OptionContainer widget. This widget already exists for macOS, GTK and Windows, so we have an API design - we just need to find a way to make this API work on mobile platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Capture&lt;/strong&gt;. We're finally going to start addressing device hardware capabilities. We're going to start with image capture - the ability to select an image from either the photo library, or take an image with the camera, and have that image available to Python code. As well as implementing this API, we're going to need to tackle permission handling in Briefcase so that apps can declare that they need access to the camera in a cross-platform way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="longer-term-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer term goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 18 months, a major focus has been ensuring that the tools we have are stable, tested, and fit for purpose. Looking forward, we'll be able to build on this foundation, adding more widgets (especially for app content navigation), and filling out notable gaps in widget platform support (such as Tree and Table widgets on mobile). We'll also start building out hardware support APIs (such as geolocation and accelerometers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in addition to adding new features, we're going to start drawing attention to the features we already have. The Toga audit has enabled us to revise our API documentation, but API documentation is only a small part of the overall documentation story. Now that we have a stable base to work with, we're going to start improving our tutorials and HowTo documentation, lowering the barrier to entry for new developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toga and Briefcase are more stable than ever, and we've addressed all the major technical challenges that existed when full-time work on BeeWare started early last year. Now we can begin the work of building on the foundation that we've established, ensuring that everyone in the Python community can build native applications for their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>September 2023 Status Update</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/september-2023-status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2023-09-30T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:162f6d11-3acf-37d5-923b-480e11f3c256</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;September has been a month of slow, but significant progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've resolved the issues around the iOS App Store rejecting BeeWare apps - and, by way of proof, we've updated our demo app, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/travel-tips/id1336372310#?platform=iphone"&gt;Travel Tips&lt;/a&gt;. We've also updated the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keith_magee.traveltips"&gt;Android version of the app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've completely reworked the tooling for building binary packages for iOS. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge"&gt;Mobile Forge&lt;/a&gt; is our new project for maintaining iOS binary builds. It provides a much more robust environment for performing cross-compilation, making use of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv"&gt;crossenv&lt;/a&gt;, rather than bespoke site package overrides. Getting crossenv working has also required us to do a deep audit of the various ways that Python reflects describes the platform it is running on, from the obvious ones like the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;platform&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sys&lt;/tt&gt; modules, down to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sysconfig&lt;/tt&gt; and the tags that are used by &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pip&lt;/tt&gt; to determine wheel compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've completed an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support"&gt;initial port of the iOS patches to Python 3.12.0rc3&lt;/a&gt;. We're still hunting some edge cases, but initial signs are promising that we'll be in a position to do a near &amp;quot;zero day&amp;quot; release of Python 3.12 support for iOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Android, we've re-enabled &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/937"&gt;Fortran support&lt;/a&gt; in the package build system, and used it to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/949"&gt;upgrade SciPy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were anticipating that would would complete the Toga Audit this month; however, that unfortunately hasn't happened. We've hit a bunch of complications with getting fonts and canvas support working on Windows and Android, and the process of getting those platforms working has revealed some inconsistencies in macOS, iOS and GTK font handling. However, we have completed the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2019"&gt;DetailedList&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903"&gt;Font&lt;/a&gt;, and the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2029"&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2112"&gt;decoupled the Winforms event loop from the main form in a Toga app&lt;/a&gt;. This doesn't have any immediate impact on existing Toga apps - but it means we're now in a position to have windowless apps, such as system tray apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We completed the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290"&gt;fixes needed to support Briefcase on Python 3.12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1425"&gt;significant improvements to subprocess encoding handling&lt;/a&gt;. This should significantly improve the user experience of Windows users, and users from non-English speaking countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1449"&gt;formally downgraded our support for AppImage to &amp;quot;Best effort&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. AppImage has proven increasingly difficult to work with as a format; now that we have native system packages and Flatpak as options, the effort needed to maintain AppImage support is better spent elsewhere. We'll still merge fixes to AppImage support if a PR is provided, but we're no longer actively fixing bugs, or running AppImage configurations in CI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1468"&gt;filters to Xcode output to hide ignorable warnings&lt;/a&gt;. Xcode builds have always been a little noisy; the new Xcode 15 release added even more noise. The filter means that these warnings will no longer distract from successful build output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we didn't complete the Toga audit in September as we anticipated. As mentioned, we hit a number of complications and inconsistencies in font handling, especially in the Canvas widget, which slowed progress. We'll keep working on this audit in October; and once we're done, we'll make a release a new version of Toga. This release will include a number of backwards-incompatible changes identified as part of the audit, so be prepared for a bumpier-than-usual upgrade process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the audit is complete, we'll also be looking at a technical limitation that the widget audit has revealed on Android. A number of Toga's Android widgets aren't as fully featured as they could be, due to the fact that accessing the full API would require subclassing a Java base class. This is an area where Chaquopy has some limitations; so we're going to try and address these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also begin the work of upstreaming patches to CPython core. We've been invited to attend the CPython Core Team Sprint this month, which will be great opportunity to lay out the roadmap for formal iOS and Android support in CPython 3.13. This will also involve working on improving the CI infrastructure for building Android and iOS packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We attended &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2023.pycon.org.au"&gt;PyCon AU 2023&lt;/a&gt;, and presented a new talk about the fundamentals of building GUI apps in Python; the video of this presentation is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH6rkImiZtc"&gt;already online&lt;/a&gt;. At the sprints, 8 new contributors earned their challenge coins, for a range of small and large fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Toga Audit is complete on macOS, iOS and GTK! The last pieces were the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2058"&gt;Window&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2075"&gt;App&lt;/a&gt;; with those PRs (and some others that are outstanding), we have 100% code coverage for Toga's codebase. Windows and Android are catching up rapidly - we've completed the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996"&gt;OptionContainer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017"&gt;Tree&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a major revamp of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2020"&gt;how layouts are calculated&lt;/a&gt;, which ensures that minimum window sizes are enforced, and layouts on High DPI displays are correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2065"&gt;Texual backend for Toga&lt;/a&gt;. This means the same Toga application will now run on 3 desktop platforms, 2 mobile platforms, as a single page web app, and in a terminal window. As with the web backend, there's still a lot of work to fill out all the widgets, but we've got enough in place to run the BeeWare tutorial app and the first 2 Toga tutorial steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1360"&gt;improved the architecture and word size checks that Briefcase performs when building apps&lt;/a&gt;. This effectively adds support for 32-bit x86 and ARM platforms; we're limited in our ability to perform automatic tests to verify these platforms work as advertised, and upstream tooling isn't always up to the task (for example, Linuxdeploy doesn't support ARM at any word size) - but Briefcase now performs much more robust checks, and will make a best effort when support &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1417"&gt;support for openSUSE (and other SUSE-derived distributions)&lt;/a&gt; to Briefcase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1397"&gt;updated the version of the Android command line tools that Briefcase uses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We resolved a long standing issue with the use of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/357"&gt;Objective C blocks on M1 hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on current progress, it seems highly likely that the Toga audit will be complete on Windows and Android by the end of September. This will bring the Toga audit to completion, providing a very stable foundation for future work on Toga. It also means you can expect a new Toga release in the coming month, incorporating the myriad bug fixes and improvements that the audit has revealed. This release will include a number of backwards-incompatible changes identified as part of the audit, so be prepared for a bumpier-than-usual upgrade process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - what comes after the audit? Firstly, we'll be looking into iOS App Store submission - we've been made aware that although Briefcase apps work fine on both device and simulator, the App Store has been rejecting apps because of an internal layout issue. We have already begun work on this, and thanks to a contribution from the community, we have a very strong foundation for this work. We'll also start looking at Python 3.12 support, and making preparations for upstreaming our iOS patches into CPython core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be looking at a technical limitation that the widget audit has revealed on Android. A number of Toga's Android widgets aren't as fully featured as they could be, due to the fact that accessing the full API would require subclassing a Java base class. This is an area where Chaquopy has some limitations; so we're going to try and address these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We attended &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu"&gt;EuroPython 2023&lt;/a&gt;, presenting on Briefcase, attending the WASM summit, and running a very successful 2 day sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've completed the audit of all Toga widgets on macOS, iOS and GTK! We've also completed the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969"&gt;ScrollContainer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984"&gt;SplitContainer&lt;/a&gt; on Windows and Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1331"&gt;Docker Desktop and rootless Docker on Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added the ability to get &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1389"&gt;detailed logs from the tools used by Briefcase to build apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've corrected some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1375"&gt;warnings generated by pip when installing Python packages on Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1377"&gt;generating APKs as an output format for Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've improved error reporting when &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1378"&gt;an application can't start on Android due to the device being too old&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1356"&gt;the Android device clock isn't in sync with the developer's laptop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__repr__&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__str__&lt;/tt&gt; implementations for Objective C structures like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/340"&gt;NSRect, NSRange, NSPoint and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2027"&gt;formally dropped support for Python 3.7 in Toga&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We improved error handling when &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2047"&gt;an app doesn't define a main window as part of it's startup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type annotations in Toga &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2044"&gt;have been significantly improved&lt;/a&gt;. We've been adding type annotations as part of the widget audit, but some types (such as callbacks) weren't as specific as they could have been. We're now using Protocols to define some of the more complex types in Toga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2050"&gt;ActivityIndicator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2051"&gt;Divider&lt;/a&gt; widget implementation in the Web backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widget testing audit is now complete on macOS, iOS and GTK. An audit of App and Window functionality is all that stands in the way of 100% test coverage on those three platforms; it seems likely we'll get there by the end of this month. Android and Windows coverage is close behind, but might take a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this delay is that we need to address an important change in the most recent release of Android Studio. Over the last few years, the Android ecosystem has been in the process of migrating its build system from Groovy to Kotlin; Android Studio Giraffe makes Kotlin the default for new projects, so we need to make sure we're compatible with that change. The widget audit has also highlighted that we need to improve our handling of subclass inheritance in Java; we're hoping to make some changes that will enable us to fill in a few more gaps in widget API coverage on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2023.pycon.org.au"&gt;PyCon AU 2023&lt;/a&gt; from August 18-22. We're presenting on Saturday; and we'll be there for the full duration of the sprints. See you in Tarntanya/Adelaide!&lt;/p&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>2023Q3 Roadmap</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/2023q3-roadmap/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2023-07-04T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:6d790618-618f-36cf-b885-9ac46f13830d</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2023 is halfway done, and BeeWare continues to make steady progress. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q2-progress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q2 progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Q1, our focus in Q2 was on Toga testing. This has been a mammoth project; but it's finally nearing completion. All but 2 widgets (Canvas and DetailedList) have 100% branch coverage on macOS, iOS and GTK, while Android and Windows are only 5 more widgets behind (ScrollContainer, SplitContainer, OptionContainer, Table and Tree). Along the way, we've identified and resolved lots of inconsistencies in widget APIs, and resolved countless bugs. We've also fully documented every widget, ported the test suite to Pytest, and added type annotations in the code (mostly for documentation purposes, rather than formal validation). We've also completed testing and coverage of a lot of the non-widget functionality that wasn’t strictly planned for this quarter - features like Images, Icons, Validators, application paths, and colors; plus a lot of tests (and bugfixes) in the core widget layout. We've also got the start of some tooling that can be used to test the Web backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning. Once Toga's code is at 100% testing coverage, we'll be in a much better place to develop those plans. We also haven't been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q3-priorities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q3 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Q3 goals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalize Toga's test suite&lt;/strong&gt;. By the end of Q3, we should have 100% branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS Binary packaging&lt;/strong&gt; We've been made aware that Apple is rejecting Briefcase packaged iOS apps from the iOS App Store because of a package layout issue associated with binary modules. This is a very high priority to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kotlin upgrades&lt;/strong&gt; The upcoming Android Studio release is switching to Kotlin as its preferred language for new Gradle configuration files; we need to upgrade Chaquopy's tooling to support this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add full support for Java inheritance&lt;/strong&gt; In the process of building Toga's test suite, it's become clear that a number of features can only be implemented by subclassing Java base classes. Chaquopy's ability to subclass is currently limited; to unlock all the features of Android, we need to resolve this limitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="longer-term-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer term goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our longer term goals are also &lt;a class="reference external" href="../2022q4-roadmap"&gt;largely unchanged&lt;/a&gt;. Toga 1.0 remains an important goal; once we're at 100% test coverage, we will be in much better place to provide estimates about Toga 1.0. Upstreaming is an area where we have some good news - as a result of discussions at Pycon US, we've received support for raising iOS and Android to the status of Tier 3 supported platforms in CPython, with the initial goal of having this in place for Python 3.13. You should expect to see movement on upstreaming towards the end of this year, and early next year. A forge for mobile packages is also remains an important goal; the completion of upstreaming work will make the goal of building a forge much more viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of Q2 2023, Toga's testing journey is nearing completion... but there's still lots of work to be done. However, the groundwork that we've been doing over the last 6 months has put us in a very strong position to develop Toga and the rest of the BeeWare ecosystem going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've completed the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946"&gt;NumberInput&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949"&gt;WebView&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951"&gt;DateInput, TimeInput&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956"&gt;ImageView&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955"&gt;Selection&lt;/a&gt; on all platforms; and we've completed the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969"&gt;ScrollContainer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984"&gt;SplitContainer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996"&gt;OptionContainer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017"&gt;Tree&lt;/a&gt; on macOS, iOS and GTK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've identified and resolved some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1958"&gt;edge cases in the Pack layout algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964"&gt;improved the implementation of application paths, and audited the paths being returned on all platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2008"&gt;corrected some issues in the Web backend caused by the most recent PyScript and Pyodide releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1992"&gt;improved the error message that is returned when a widget isn't implemented on a platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've updated Briefcase to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271"&gt;use Java 17 when building Android projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added support for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1307"&gt;ANDROID_HOME environment variable&lt;/a&gt; when building Android projects with a pre-existing copy of Android Studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widget testing audit has been a mammoth project, but the end is very nearly in sight. There's only 2 widgets (Canvas and DetailedList) that haven't seen any testing to date; plus there's some non-widget features (like dialogs, fonts, windows, and basic App functionality) that still require testing. Once those tests are complete, we'll be moving on to dealing with some iOS and Android deployment issues that have been accumulating while we focused on Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu"&gt;EuroPython 2023&lt;/a&gt; from July 17-23. We're presenting on Thursday; and we'll be there for the full duration of the sprints. See you in Prague!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've completed the audit of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944"&gt;TextInput, PasswordInput,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1938"&gt;MultilineTextInput&lt;/a&gt; widgets; we've completed the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946"&gt;NumberInput&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949"&gt;WebView&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951"&gt;DateInput, TimeInput&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955"&gt;Selection&lt;/a&gt; on macOS, iOS and GTK; and we've begun the audit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956"&gt;ImageView&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added documentation and tests for the input validation API as part of the TextInput audit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added documentation and tests for ListSource as part of the Selection audit, and modified the implementation of Selection to use a ListSource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1948"&gt;refactored the implementation of Dialog&lt;/a&gt; so that it is architecturally consistent with the rest of Toga; this will hopefully also lead to an easier testing story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903"&gt;significant progress in supporting custom fonts on GTK&lt;/a&gt;, including adding a GUI test of this capability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1093"&gt;completed a refactor of Briefcase's tool integrations&lt;/a&gt;. This introduces a consistent API for all tools that Briefcase uses, as well as introducing type annotations for a lot more of the codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've introduced &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1262"&gt;conditional coverage to the Briefcase codebase&lt;/a&gt;. This means developers who only have access to a single testing platform can get a 100% coverage report on their work before submitting to CI for cross-platform confirmation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've helped triage a number of bugs in the Python 3.12.0b1 release (revealed by our testing for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290"&gt;Briefcase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/issues/313"&gt;Rubicon-ObjC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've modified Briefcase's Flatpak backend to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1272"&gt;require an explicit runtime&lt;/a&gt;, rather than falling back to a default runtime that is no longer supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We developed a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285"&gt;draft implementation of a Briefcase test runner for the Web backend&lt;/a&gt;. This is an important first step to being able to unit test Toga's Web backend; however, there's still a couple of technical challenges outstanding before we can complete that work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've begun the process of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271"&gt;upgrading Briefcase's Java support from Java 8 to Java 17&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June will be another month with a focus on GUI test coverage. We're still hoping that this work will be complete by the end of June - we're averaging 1-2 widgets a week, and we have 8 widgets remaining; however, every widget is throwing up unique challenges (and revealing deep bugs - sometimes in the underlying GUI frameworks), so it's possible the audit work may need to continue into July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon US saw a lot of BeeWare activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We presented 2 talks at PyCon US - one on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/20/"&gt;Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;, and one on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/145/"&gt;state of Android support on Python&lt;/a&gt;. Videos of these talks should appear on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/pyconus"&gt;PyCon US Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We presented at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/language-summit/"&gt;Language Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where we received provisional approval to push for iOS and Android to become Tier 3 supported platforms in CPython 3.13.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We presented at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/packaging-summit/"&gt;Packaging Summit&lt;/a&gt;, providing the needs of packaging from a mobile perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a booth in the community section of the conference show floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran a successful sprint where we handed out over a dozen Challenge Coins. Many of the improvements listed in this status update come from community contributions, and we have a backlog of other PRs we're still working on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We donated an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fosstodon.org/&amp;#64;beeware/110245889923864511"&gt;leather Briefcase to the PyLadies Auction, raising US$800!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In non-PyCon activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added the ability to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/890"&gt;code sign Windows release artefacts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a new distribution format for Windows apps - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1183"&gt;simple ZIP archives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified Briefcase to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1219"&gt;support PEP621 metadata standards&lt;/a&gt;. Briefcase predates the definition of PEP621, but there's a lot of overlap in what PEP621 defines and what Briefcase defines, so it makes sense for Briefcase to adhere to the common standard. In future, we expect to see more convergence with PEP621 standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We landed major updates to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1132"&gt;Briefcase's AppImage and Flatpak backends&lt;/a&gt;. They now use Indygreg's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone"&gt;Standalone Python&lt;/a&gt;;  this significantly speeds up Flatpak builds, should be more stable on AppImage, allows us to switch to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/pypa/manylinux"&gt;manylinux&lt;/a&gt; base images - and it reduces the number of projects that BeeWare is responsible for maintaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got 2 more widgets to 100% GUI test coverage. One of these is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1834"&gt;base widget&lt;/a&gt;, so we're now able to guarantee basic functionality across all widgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We migrated Toga's web backend to use the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1838"&gt;Shoelace web components framework&lt;/a&gt;. This is a much better match for Toga than Bootstrap was, as it is primarily focussed on rendering &lt;em&gt;widgets&lt;/em&gt;, rather than HTML layout. We only have a handful of widgets ported over at this point - but the process of implementing widgets is relatively straightforward, so if you have web skills and are looking for a way to contribute, this would be a great place to get involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1894"&gt;cursor visibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1863"&gt;full screen mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1871"&gt;determining the current window&lt;/a&gt; on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an API for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1880"&gt;catching a 'confirm' action on TextInput widgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1836"&gt;FreeBSD in Toga&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a number of significant improvements to the Tox configurations to improve reliability, work around a bugs in the release of pip 23.1, speed up and parallelise test execution, enforce spelling and external linking in documentation, and to make easier to obtain coverage reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, we'll be continuing our push for GUI test coverage. Our current aim is to have complete widget coverage by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>2023Q2 Roadmap</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/2023q2-roadmap/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2023-04-04T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:8c6f21df-0fed-3554-a131-c5a8d8e90687</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It doesn't feel like it's been three months since our last roadmap update... but here we are, in April 2023. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q1-progress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q1 progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus this quarter has been on testing; however as with our last report, our progress has not been as significant as we hoped it would be. Getting the first tests in place has proved to be much more complex than we anticipated. In order to test widgets &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, we've had to set up all the infrastructure that will be necessary to test every other widget, such as defining the probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to ensure that the GUI framework has finished applying changes before performing a test assertion. The process of building the first tests has exposed a number of problems deeply embedded in the core of Toga - problems that either aren't observable or are easily masked when you're writing an application as a user, but can't be avoided when you're writing a test suite that will run fast and needs to have repeatable behavior. We're also testing the limits of the features exposed by each platform - and everything we do needs to be repeated on 5 GUI toolkits with 5 completely different views of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that as of the end of Q1, we're finally getting traction on the problem. We're about a quarter of the way through the widgets by count. Admittedly, we've been tackling the simpler widgets first - but the lessons learned (and bugs fixed) making those simple widgets work should make testing the more complex widgets easier. There's also some commonality in the more complex widgets - for example, TextInput, PasswordInput and NumberInput are all essentially the same widget, so once tests are built for one of them, the other 2 should fall out reasonably easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also been able to release Toga v0.3.0. This release was almost 5 years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q1 saw some unexpected improvements to Briefcase. We've had persistent problems supporting AppImage and Flatpak as packaging formats; during Q1, we couldn't avoid these problems any longer, so we introduced a System packaging backend, and made this the new default for Linux apps. We're now able to produce native system packages for Briefcase apps, supporting almost every Debian, Red Hat or Arch derived distribution. These packages are already proving more stable: we had no major issues during a recent tutorial at Everything Open 2023, despite a wide variety of Linux distributions in the room - something that we've never been able to say about AppImage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once again, that means there's a lot left on the Q1 TODO list. Toga documentation is being slowly updated as we audit each widget; however, we haven't made any changes to the example apps; we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning; and we haven't been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q2-priorities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q2 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our short term goals are, therefore, largely unchanged from last quarter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - Completing the Toga GUI testing suite will again be our primary focus for the quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt; - Once we've got the test harness in place, we'll be in a much better position to evaluate what work remains to get to v1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; - The process of systematically building a test suite also gives us an opportunity to update the API documentation for each widget as we go. There's still lots of documentation required on top of the API guide, but complete API documentation will be a big start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-platform hardware&lt;/strong&gt; - Cross-platform support for device hardware (especially mobile) is one of the banner features that makes mobile device support worthwhile. Providing proof that this hardware support is easy to use will be a key demonstrator for BeeWare as a platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="longer-term-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer term goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our longer term goals are also &lt;a class="reference external" href="../2022q4-roadmap"&gt;largely unchanged&lt;/a&gt;. Upstreaming, Toga 1.0, and a forge for mobile packages are all important goals for the BeeWare ecosystem. However, we don't expect to make any significant progress on most of these goals until we have solidified Toga's testing story. We should, however, see at least the first signs of progress on upstreaming BeeWare's work on mobile as a result of PyCon US, where we'll have a chance to raise issues directly with the Python core team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a robust GUI testing framework for Toga has definitely proven to be a lot more complicated than we originally thought. The good news is that as of the end of Q1 2023, we're finally starting to make good progress on testing. We hope that by the time of our next status update, we're able to report that we're nearing the end of our testing journey, and we can turn our focus to other areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress on GUI testing in Toga is continuing. We now have 7 widgets fully tested, with another 2 in progress. As with last month's update, getting these tests passing has required wrestling a lot of fundamentals, in particular around the simulation of events such as mouse clicks. We're also discovering (and fixing) lots of corner cases in widget implementations that only surface when you're doing rigorous and repeatable testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've made some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1794"&gt;major changes to the way GTK widgets are rendered&lt;/a&gt;. This change significantly reduces the amount of re-rendering that is performed by GTK, as well as resolving a number of long standing issues related to resizing widgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to some community contributions, we were were able to add support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1817"&gt;focus events and text alignment&lt;/a&gt; on GTK's TextInput widget, and support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1821"&gt;text alignment and fonts&lt;/a&gt; on GTK's NumberInput widget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We landed the implementation of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1106"&gt;Linux system package backend&lt;/a&gt; for Briefcase, which can output DEB and RPM packages. Thanks to a community contribution, we were also able to add support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1143"&gt;Arch packages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1107"&gt;locations where Briefcase outputs build artefacts&lt;/a&gt;. This removes some sources of bugs associated with tools not supporting spaces in filenames, and makes Briefcase's output consistent with other tools in the Python ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made significant progress on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1132"&gt;modifying Briefcase's AppImage and Flatpak backends&lt;/a&gt; to use Indygreg's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone"&gt;Standalone Python&lt;/a&gt;, rather than BeeWare's Linux support package. Standalone Python is becoming a de facto standard for pre-compiled Python builds (especially on Linux), so it makes sense for BeeWare to converge on this common standard. This change will also significantly speed up Flatpak builds, should be more stable on AppImage, allows us to switch to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/pypa/manylinux"&gt;manylinux&lt;/a&gt; base images - and it reduces the number of projects that BeeWare is responsible for maintaining. We're currently waiting on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk/pull/45"&gt;fix to the linuxdeploy GTK plugin&lt;/a&gt; to be merged before we can land this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to a community contribution, we added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1125"&gt;PyGame&lt;/a&gt; to Briefcase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We migrated BeeWare's CI to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/.github/pull/14"&gt;use the new System packaging backend&lt;/a&gt; on Linux. This means that CI is significantly faster, as building system packages requires a lot less processing than an AppImage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/travertino/"&gt;released Travertino 0.2.0&lt;/a&gt;. Travertino is the library that underpins Toga's Pack layout algorithm. It's been several years since we last did a Travertino release, but some recent bug fixes warranted an update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We presented a tutorial at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2023.everythingopen.au"&gt;Everything Open 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made a big change to our social media strategy: we started a Mastodon account. We've wound down our Twitter usage at the end of last year; going forward, you can get your bite size BeeWare updates from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fosstodon.org/&amp;#64;beeware"&gt;&amp;#64;beeware&amp;#64;fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of technical goals, April will continue our push for GUI test coverage. However, we're expecting progress to be a little slower, because of one big event - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pycon.us/2023"&gt;PyCon US&lt;/a&gt;. We'll have a booth in the community section of the conference floor; the core team are presenting 2 talks; we're presenting at the Language Summit; and we'll be at the sprints for the first 3 days. Preparing for these talks will take up a lot of our time in April, as will the event itself - so progress is likely to be a little slower than normal. If you're going to be there, come by the booth and say hi! If you'd like to help us to staff the booth - get in touch &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/bee/chat/"&gt;on Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fosstodon.org/&amp;#64;beeware"&gt;on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:contact&amp;#64;beeware.org"&gt;or email&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest milestone is that we have achieved 100% test coverage for our first widget - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1761"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;! This may sound a little underwhelming - after all, Toga has had a Button widget for a long time, and has been fairly reliable. However, getting to this point has required a lot of smaller (seemingly unrelated) problems to be solved. It has also required setting up all the infrastructure that will be necessary to test every other widget, such as defining the probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to ensure that the GUI framework has finished applying changes before performing a test assertion). We've also taken this opportunity to start migrating the Toga unit tests to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pytest&lt;/tt&gt;, which promises to significantly improve our testing capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1778"&gt;formalised the relationship between Toga's Pack layout model and CSS&lt;/a&gt;. This should make it a lot easier to determine what &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; layout behavior should be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1794"&gt;identified a low level issue with the way that layout is performed on GTK, and possibly with other platforms&lt;/a&gt;. We're still working through the consequences of this change, but it has indirectly resolved a number of issues we have seen reported with widget layouts, especially on GTK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1078"&gt;ability to pass command line arguments to running apps&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;briefcase dev&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;briefcase run&lt;/tt&gt; interface. This was primarily done to make it easier to run unit test suites; but it can be used for any other reason you might want to use a command line argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1106"&gt;draft implementation of a Linux system packaging backend&lt;/a&gt; for Briefcase. We've had consistent problems with both AppImage and Flatpak, most of which can be traced back to resolving links to system packages. We're not going to remove these backends - when AppImage and Flatpak work, they're great options - but we're going to change the default packaging backend on Linux to be system packages (i.e., DEB/RPM etc). This makes the simple case of building a package for your own system much easier, while retaining the ability to build packages for other distributions as required. We're hoping to land this PR in the coming month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1102"&gt;corrected an issue with threading modes&lt;/a&gt; that prevented some Windows apps (especially PySide/Qt apps) from displaying dialogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1113"&gt;corrected an issue with the Briefcase Web backend&lt;/a&gt; that would cause intermittent errors when loading a web app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We updated our CI infrastructure to make better use of shared task definitions. BeeWare has a lot of Github repositories, and a lot of common tasks (such as rolling out an app across multiple Python and operating system versions). Previously, each Github repository had an independent set of CI task definitions; we've now got a central collection of task definitions that is used by all repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We cleaned up the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1762"&gt;table in Toga's documentation describing the state of support of each widget&lt;/a&gt;.  This allows us to differentiate between widgets that we've fully tested, and widgets that exist, but haven't been tested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to a community contribution, we've been able to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/chaquopy/pull/4"&gt;publish a backlog of iOS binary packages for Python 3.8-3.11&lt;/a&gt;. For the packages we currently support (including Numpy, Pandas, Pillow and more), we're now able to offer an iOS binary wheel for every published version for which there is a corresponding macOS wheel, going back to 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, we'll be continuing to improve GUI test coverage. Now that we've got one widget to 100% coverage, we know we have all the core testing infrastructure in place, so it should be much easier to implement tests for the future widgets. By the end of March, we should have a lot more widgets at 100% coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be presenting at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2023.everythingopen.au"&gt;Everything Open 2023&lt;/a&gt;. If you're attending, come say hi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had two big releases in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we released Briefcase 0.3.12. This is the first Briefcase release in 3 months, so it includes a lot of improvements, but the most notable improvements are the new &amp;quot;Testing mode&amp;quot;, a major improvement to the Android build process, and a huge number of bug fixes and improvements - especially on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly - and more importantly - we released Toga 0.3.0! No more dev releases or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;--pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; flags for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pip&lt;/tt&gt; - the stable release of Toga on PyPI is now closely tracking actual development. It's been over 5 years since we last released an official stable Toga version, even though we've been recommending the dev releases for most of that time. However, as a result of a number of changes that landed this month, we're finally committing to the 0.3.0 branch properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These releases incorporate changes going back months (and years); but we made some very specific progress during January:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaquopy &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-14-0-2/"&gt;had a new release.&lt;/a&gt;, significantly improving build times on Android, improving the rendering of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;stdout&lt;/tt&gt; content in the Android logs, adding some features that make it easier to expose the original project source code in the running app bundle, and enabling PEP517 builds of project dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Briefcase is now able to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1058"&gt;reference local source packages when building Linux AppImage binaries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some errors caused by the way the Windows Store version of Python handles local application data &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1054"&gt;have been corrected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Briefcase's help text now &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1005"&gt;shows the list of platforms and output formats&lt;/a&gt;, rather than requiring an additional help call to retrieve that information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some issues with thread and asyncio safety in Rubicon ObjC were &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/246"&gt;identified and resolved&lt;/a&gt;, along with an issue associated with the way some Objective C classes (such as NSWindow) are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/258"&gt;renamed at runtime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial GUI testing backends for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1707"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1749"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1755"&gt;GTK&lt;/a&gt; were added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A long standing issue with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1439"&gt;replacement of root window content&lt;/a&gt; on GTK and iOS has been resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coverage testing was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1747"&gt;added to the Toga Android GUI test backend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An API was added to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1728"&gt;allow scrolling MultilineTextInput widgets&lt;/a&gt; to the top and bottom of the widget content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The work &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1675"&gt;moving Toga to use Setuptools-SCM&lt;/a&gt; was completed. Development versions of Toga will now report a specific version control commit; release versions have their version determined by the git tag used to produce the release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We completed a major review of the way we're using Github issue labels, and modified those labels to be consistent across all repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the last 3 months have been spent getting a GUI testing framework in place for Toga. That work is now in place, so now we'll be working full time on writing GUI tests for Toga, with the aim of getting Toga to 100% coverage. Along the way, we'll discover all the edge cases, bugs, and partially missing implementations that are lurking in the individual Toga widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>2023Q1 Roadmap</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/2023q1-roadmap/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2023-01-11T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:4108ae51-a5a7-3c55-976f-b9c970b4fe79</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a new year! 2022 saw some amazing progress for BeeWare; and we've got some big plans for 2023. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q4-progress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q4 progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress in Q4 was not as significant as we originally planned. A combination of conference travel and holiday leave meant the quarter was shorter than most; but even then, our goals for the quarter were extremely optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to hit our goal for &lt;strong&gt;Web deployment&lt;/strong&gt;. We've restored the Toga web backend to a working state, and we've added a Web deployment backend to Briefcase. There's still a lot of work required before Web deployment is a viable as a production solution, but the initial pieces are now in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also able to hit our goals on &lt;strong&gt;housekeeping&lt;/strong&gt;. We've made a lot of improvements to the base infrastructure of repositories, enabling Black, pre-commit, and towncrier in Toga, and improving coverage reporting (including getting to 100% branch coverage in Briefcase's test suite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've made significant progress on improving the &lt;strong&gt;testing&lt;/strong&gt; story for BeeWare apps. We've added the ability for Briefcase projects to run normal Python test suites inside a packaged app, and we've demonstrated that we can use this capability to run CI for iOS and Android apps (as well as desktop platforms). This feature will be included in the next Briefcase release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this new testing capability, we've started building a GUI test suite for Toga. This is a critical part of ensuring the quality of Toga going forward; but getting this testing framework in place has revealed lots of complications and bugs. We're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plans to release Toga v0.3 final have also been delayed. The process of adding SCM-based versioning to the repository (part of the housekeeping task) revealed a bug that prevented code running on Android; fixing that bug became a blocker on the release of Toga v0.3. We've now resolved that problem, so we should be able to release Toga v0.3 final as soon as the fix has been released into the BeeWare's Android tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that leaves a lot on the Q4 TODO list. We haven't made any changes to the example apps; Toga documentation is mostly unchanged; we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning; and we haven't been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q1-priorities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q1 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably unsurprising that Q1 2023 will be picking up on items we didn't get around to in Q4 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - Completing the Toga GUI testing suite will be our primary focus for the quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt; - Once we've got the test harness in place, we'll be in a much better position to evaluate what work remains to get to v1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; - The process of systematically building a test suite also gives us an opportunity to update the API documentation for each widget as we go. There's still lots of documentation required on top of the API guide, but complete API documentation will be a big start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-platform hardware&lt;/strong&gt; - Cross-platform support for device hardware (especially mobile) is one of the banner features that makes mobile device support worthwhile. Providing proof that this hardware support is easy to use will be a key demonstrator for BeeWare as a platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="longer-term-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer term goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our longer term goals are largely &lt;a class="reference external" href="../2022q4-roadmap"&gt;unchanged from Q4 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Upstreaming, Toga 1.0, and a forge for mobile packages are all important goals for the BeeWare ecosystem. However, we don't expect to make any significant progress on these goals until we have solidified Toga's testing story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seeming lack of progress made in Q4 was definitely disappointing; but the work hasn't been wasted. Progress has been slow specifically because the problems we're trying to solve are hard, and reveal every gnarled edge case that platforms have to offer. We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; making progress, though; and once we've got the Toga testing framework stabilized, we'll be in a much stronger position to make predictions for future work on Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

As a result, we've got less to report than in past months; however, some significant progress and improvements have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During December:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We continued to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1002"&gt;fine tune Briefcase's recently added test mode&lt;/a&gt;. This reflects issues that have been discovered as we continue to build Toga's GUI test suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We updated Briefcase's Web backend to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1006"&gt;support changes made in the 2022.12.1 release of PyScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fixed a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/993"&gt;bug preventing the use of local file references in requirements when building Linux AppImages&lt;/a&gt;. As a side effect, this change also makes it much easier to get a debug session inside the Docker container used to build AppImages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We merged the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1687"&gt;first draft of the Toga GUI testbed&lt;/a&gt;. There is still a lot of work to be done on this testbed, but it provides a solid foundation on which we can build tests of Toga's cross-platform GUI behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1710"&gt;mouse events on the Canvas on GTK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We corrected a bug on Windows where local date formats would cause the DateInput widget to crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fixed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/238"&gt;a bug in Rubicon that would cause background threads to stall on iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There won't be much more progress from the core team for the rest of this year. We'll still be around to handle critical problems, answer questions and do code reviews for contributors; but our response times might be a little slower than normal. We'll publish our Q1 2023 roadmap when we return in January - but we'll be largely picking up where this year has left off - improving the testing story for Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="want-to-get-involved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to get involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:&lt;/p&gt;

Although these changes don't have an immediate impact for users, they're going to form a vital part of our work going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During November:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/962"&gt;added a test mode to Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;. This is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; step forward, as it means we are now able to run automated tests for iOS and Android, as well as validation tests for packaged app behaviors. As a proof of concept, we've already begun porting our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-support-testbed/pull/6"&gt;support package validation app&lt;/a&gt; - this is an app that we've historically needed to run manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/954"&gt;added the ability for an AppImage to customise the Dockerfile used to build the project&lt;/a&gt;. This was required to support the use of Rust-based dependencies (such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cryptography.io/"&gt;cryptography&lt;/a&gt;) in AppImages; however, the approach we've taken should allow for any other customisation that may be required, without the need to maintain a fork of the AppImage project template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/974"&gt;added the ability for users to add customisations to the Android Gradle file for their projects&lt;/a&gt;. As with the Dockerfile changes, this allows for small customisations without the need to use a completely forked template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/956"&gt;improved the resilience of Briefcase on flaky network connections&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, an interrupted download of a support package could leave Briefcase in a broken state; this should no longer be possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/964"&gt;improved type hinting in the Briefcase codebase&lt;/a&gt;, especially relating to the ToolCache class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/966"&gt;improved the handling of Android apps that fail immediately on app startup&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, if your app crashed due to something like a Python syntax error, it was possible for Briefcase to hang in a way that made it look like the issue was due to Briefcase being unable to start the app, rather than a user code problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/970"&gt;corrected a problem on Windows that was preventing app output from being captured in the Briefcase log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We completed the process of modernising the layout and tooling of the Toga repository, including the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1639"&gt;introduction of Black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1638"&gt;Towncrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1675"&gt;setuptools_scm&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1669"&gt;large reorganisation of the code structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1687"&gt;begun building the first automated test of Toga's GUI behavior&lt;/a&gt;. This is still in the early stages, but it will form the a core part of our testing infrastructure in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added preliminary support for Python 3.12 to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/965"&gt;Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1677"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/231"&gt;Rubicon ObjC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/230"&gt;updated the codebase of Rubicon-ObjC to use Black&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December will be a slow month due to the Christmas and New Year break; however, until then, we'll continue to focus will continue to be on testing. We'll continue to build out the testing tools that we've worked on this month, and start building tests using those tools. We also hope to begin work on a firm 1.0 roadmap for Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Progress in October was a little slower than in past months; preparing for and attending DjangoCon US, plus some well-earned holiday leave reduced the amount of time we had to work on new features. However, we were able to make a number of significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During October:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We restored the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1475"&gt;web backend for Toga&lt;/a&gt;! Web deployment has always been part of the BeeWare story, but we hit some technological challenges with the approach that we were taking in the Toga 0.2 branch. However, with the addition of WASM as an officially supported platform in CPython 3.11, and the release of PyScript, we have a new way of getting Python in the browser. We have been able to use these tools to build a much improved Toga web backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/898"&gt;deploying Briefcase apps as static web sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released official support for Python 3.11 on macOS, iOS and Linux - on the day that Python 3.11 was released!. Python 3.11 support for Android and Windows is ready to go, and should be published in a day or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified Briefcase to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/911"&gt;write its logs into subdirectory&lt;/a&gt;, instead of littering them in the project directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2022.djangocon.us/talks/how-to-turn-your-website-into-an-app-and/"&gt;presented a talk at DjangoCon US 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The video for this talk should be up in around a month. A major feature of this talk was a demo of an Electron-style &amp;quot;web site as an app&amp;quot;, built entirely in Python. This demo (called Positron) has been &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1612"&gt;included in the Toga repository as an example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We attended the DjangoCon US 2022 sprints, and handed out 4 &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/contributing/challenge-coins/"&gt;challenge coins&lt;/a&gt; to new contributors!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added the ability to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1599"&gt;retrieve widgets by ID&lt;/a&gt; to the Toga API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a big change to the way that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1534"&gt;Toga backends are discovered&lt;/a&gt;. This new approach has two major advantages - firstly, it means third-parties can register their own backends; but more importantly, it means that code no longer needs to explicitly provide a backend. This simplifies the creation of test cases - but it also means that icons, images and fonts no longer need to be &amp;quot;late bound&amp;quot;. This is an internal detail, but it significantly simplifies the code using those data types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added the ability to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1588"&gt;create Image objects from raw data&lt;/a&gt;, rather than an image file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started the process of modernising the layout and tooling of the Toga repository. Some of these changes have already landed; more will come in the coming days. This ensures that we have a stable foundation for future work on Toga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During November, we continuing to focus on Toga, with a particular focus on testing. A particular focus will be working out how to test graphical features of Toga - an area that has historically been managed entirely with manual testing. Having strong automated testing of graphical features will be a key milestone in ensuring Toga remains stable in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved? Here's 8 open issues that would be a great place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/753"&gt;Improve protection against corrupted or incomplete downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>2022Q4 Roadmap</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/2022q4-roadmap/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-10-04T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:9b71e18d-eb1a-34aa-8bf9-589dd3532e1a</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With Q3 completed, it's time to provide an update on the long term goals and priorities of the BeeWare project. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q3-progress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q3 progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to hit our biggest Q3 goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux packaging&lt;/strong&gt; - We've investigated and addressed all the known issues with Linux packaging. There's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/886"&gt;one pending enhancement&lt;/a&gt; that would expand the range of third-party binary packages that can be included in Briefcase projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows packaging&lt;/strong&gt; - We've introduced a stub binary for Windows apps (as well as a Visual Studio target for Windows projects). This allowed us to significantly improve log capture, so when a Windows app crashes it's a lot easier to obtain diagnostic information. This change also corrected &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the issues with the way Windows apps were using the site module; however, there is still &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/381"&gt;one issue related to the handling of packages that have complex post-installation processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary modules&lt;/strong&gt; - By far the biggest achievement of Q3. With the release of Briefcase 0.3.10, we now support binary modules on iOS and Android. We have also published 40 of the most popular binary modules, compiled for iOS and Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we didn't hit all our goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - Testing support has improved substantially. We have a much more thorough CI configuration on Briefcase that verifies that templates generate valid projects. We also have &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-support-testbed"&gt;a testbed project&lt;/a&gt; that we can use to check that support packages are behaving correctly. However, we are not yet able to run this test project in CI, so we don't have automated validation of PRs against the support packages. We also made very little progress in GUI testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conda integration&lt;/strong&gt; - We began initial discussions around Conda integration, on two fronts: firstly, to investigate the possibility of using Conda as a base for package management in apps; and secondly, about using conda-forge as a framework for managing community contributions. Both of these conversations are ongoing; it will likely take some time before these efforts bear fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q4-priorities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q4 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q4, we're planning to focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="toga"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toga&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary focus for Q4 will be Toga. There are a number of pieces of work involved with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housekeeping&lt;/strong&gt; - Basic repository maintenance tasks, like enabling &lt;cite&gt;black&lt;/cite&gt;, introducing pre-commit hooks, towncrier, and automating release infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example consolidation&lt;/strong&gt; - Toga's examples folder has become a sprawling collection of code that is part documentation, part testbed. We need to start consolidating these examples into 2 apps - one that is a user-facing demonstrator of Toga features, and one that can be used as a functional test of Toga features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - Modernising and cleaning up the existing test suite, and working out how to automate GUI tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; - Toga's documentation has lagged behind an acceptable standard for a long time,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt; - Developing a clear plan for what will be in Toga 1.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-platform hardware&lt;/strong&gt; - While it has always been &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; possible to support the APIs needed to access device hardware, there hasn't been a cross-platform API for this work. In Q4, we hope to demonstrate at least 1 interesting piece of mobile device hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we won't get to Toga v1.0 in Q4, we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; land a v0.3 final, after several years of maintaining dev pre-releases as the main way to use Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="web-support"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toga has historically had support for the Web as a platform; however, that effort was put on hold because the approach we were taking wasn't proving viable. However, with the release of Python 3.11, WASM becomes an officially supported CPython platform. We've also seen the release of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pyscript.net"&gt;PyScript&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating that client-side Python in the browser is an extremely viable proposition. The time has come to resurrect BeeWare's support for the web as a deployment platform. This will involve getting Toga's web backend into a working state, and adding a web deployment backend for Briefcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="longer-term-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer term goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking into next year, the big items on the horizon are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="upstreaming"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Upstreaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With binary modules now being supported on both iOS and Android, and the introduction of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/"&gt;Tier 3 support level in PEP11&lt;/a&gt;,  the prospect of elevating iOS and Android to official supported platforms is seeming increasingly plausible. Our hope is to go to PyCon US next year in a position to make a concrete proposal to the CPython core team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="toga-1-0"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toga 1.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad goal for &amp;quot;Toga 1.0&amp;quot; could be considered &amp;quot;Tkinter, but with some additional bells to show off&amp;quot;. We want to deliver a core widget set of the &amp;quot;essentials&amp;quot;, plus some nice features to show off, like WebViews and camera or GPS integration. We hope to establish the feature list for Toga 1.0 in Q4; once that plan is in place, we'll have a better idea of when we will be able to deliver on that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-forge-for-mobile-packages"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Forge for mobile packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, all binary modules for mobile platforms are being maintained by the BeeWare team. This isn't a viable solution long term; we need to move to an environment where the community can manage binary packages for mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 6 months, the focus of BeeWare has been on Briefcase and the support packages - ensuring that we have a feature complete, robust set of tools for deploying apps on any platform. In Q4, our focus is shifting to the tools we need to build apps &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; those platforms, and ensuring we have a stable foundation for future development. It's taken a long time for BeeWare to get this far - but we're getting very close to unlocking the remarkable potential of the Python ecosystem on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>September 2022 Status Update</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/september-2022-status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-10-03T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:ba264dae-dc08-37e9-80f7-9d610f61b2fa</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;September has been a big month for the BeeWare team. There have been lots of small updates - but there's one very large, eagerly anticipated update that has taken several months to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During September:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added support for binary packages on mobile platforms! There's more detail related to this than can fit in a bullet point; more details below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added the ability to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/854"&gt;remove files from a templated app&lt;/a&gt;. This can be used to trim down a project, removing parts of the Python interpreter that you don't need (such as standard library modules that you don't need)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've changed the way we use templates, switching to using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/862"&gt;branches based on the Briefcase release, rather than the Python release&lt;/a&gt;. This enables us to make development changes to templates without affecting the published stable release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/801"&gt;reworked the way Briefcase manages integrations with the tools needed to build apps&lt;/a&gt;. This was a mammoth project, but as a result the process of verifying tools is faster, and a number of bugs related to having stale builds have been resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've made a number of improvements to console handling of log messages, especially on Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We improved error handling in Toga when &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1589"&gt;TLS1.2 or TLS1.3 isn't supported by Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started conversations with the teams at Anaconda responsible for conda about using Conda as a base for Briefcase apps, and on using Conde-forge style infrastructure to support binary packaging. Nothing concrete has come from these conversations yet; these conversations are ongoing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="binary-package-support-you-say"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Binary package support you say?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the new binary packaging support is contained in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.10/"&gt;Briefcase 0.3.10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Android, binary module support was achieved by moving to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chaquo.com"&gt;Chaquopy&lt;/a&gt; as a base for Android projects. Along with support for binary modules, this change has the added benefit of faster startup times, and less bugs at runtime. This means you'll need to re-generate any Android project - the Python source code should work as-is, but there's no simple way to convert the Android Gradle project from the older Rubicon base to the newer Chaquopy base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On iOS, we've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/161"&gt;reworked how the support packages are constructed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/849"&gt;added support for installing binary modules from a Beeware-specific package repository that includes builds of iOS binary wheels&lt;/a&gt;. We've also added asset signing to the iOS Xcode project - and applied the same changes to the macOS backends. Of course, this also means you'll need to re-generate any iOS project to take advantage of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are now able to support binary packages on mobile platforms, this doesn't mean that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; binary package is automatically supported. Binary wheels need to be compiled for mobile platforms, and compiling for mobile platforms can be complicated. However, we've compiled ~40 of them most popular packages with binary components (including numpy, pandas, cryptography, pillow and matplotlib), and made them available as dependencies. In order to get working builds, some of these packages are slightly older versions (e.g., cryptography is a version from before the introduction of the rust dependency); however, we've endeavoured to provide the most recent versions possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full list of supported packages can be found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chaquo.com/pypi-7.0/"&gt;on the Chaquopy package repository for Android&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://anaconda.org/beeware/repo"&gt;BeeWare repository for iOS&lt;/a&gt;. If your project uses one of these packages, you only need to add them to the &lt;cite&gt;requires&lt;/cite&gt; definition in your &lt;cite&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/cite&gt;, then update and re-build your project, and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a package you want that isn't on this list, you'll need to request a binary wheel. For Android, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/issues"&gt;open a ticket on the Chaquopy repository&lt;/a&gt;. For iOS, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/chaquopy"&gt;open a ticket on this repository&lt;/a&gt;. If you're adventurous, you can also try building wheels yourself. The issue trackers are on a project that has as &amp;quot;forge-like&amp;quot; tool for building wheels, in the &lt;cite&gt;server/pypi&lt;/cite&gt; folder; there are tools and documentation describing how to build a package. The use of these projects is a short-term measure; in the longer term, we want to move to an actual “forge”-style community-managed model for managing binary packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, the focus of the BeeWare team has been on Briefcase and the support packages. In October (and the rest of Q4), we'll be shifting our focus to Toga. The initial focus will be on improving the foundation of the project - testing and build infrastructure; but once those pieces are in place, we'll start adding new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2022.djangocon.us"&gt;DjangoCon US&lt;/a&gt; in San Diego - and there will be some web-related updates related to the presentation that will be given at that conference. We hope we'll see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="want-to-get-involved"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to get involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved? Here's 10 open issues that would be a great place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/883"&gt;Write Briefcase logs into a subdirectory, instead of the project folder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/753"&gt;Improve protection against corrupted or incomplete downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865"&gt;Modify the handling of app signing options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/880"&gt;Modify the Briefcase new project wizard to show which repository and branch it's using&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780"&gt;Filter out a message generated after Xcode updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/856"&gt;Add the ability to refresh the support package in a project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853"&gt;Provide protection against creating projects with &amp;quot;semi-reserved&amp;quot; names&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808"&gt;Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463"&gt;Add support for the ANDROID_HOME environment variable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/882"&gt;Silence an warning that is displayed when an Android emulator has no skin defined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Although we haven't got the final results of this work yet, we have significant progress to report for both iOS and Android. We've also had a number of other improvements land over the course of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have continued to work on the changes needed to migrate Android support to Chaquopy. This has included some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-android-gradle-template/pull/52"&gt;major changes to the Android Gradle template&lt;/a&gt;, and developing a Rubicon Java compatibility layer. Eventually, Toga will migrate to use the Chaquopy APIs directly, but in the interim, the Rubicon APIs will continue to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have started updating Chaquopy to support multiple Python versions. Historically, Chaquopy has only supported a single Python3 version (3.8); for compatibility with Briefcase, we are adding support for Python 3.9 and 3.10, as well as preparing the ground for a 3.11 release when Python 3.11 is finalised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have modified the Python Apple support packages to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/161"&gt;provide the binary portions of the Python standard library as dynamically loaded binary modules&lt;/a&gt;, and modified the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-iOS-Xcode-template/pull/7"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-macOS-Xcode-template/pull/10"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt; templates to use and sign these binary modules. These changes haven't landed yet, but they have been tested on simulators and physical devices. Along the way, we've also updated the support packages to use OpenSSL 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have modified Briefcase to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/805"&gt;make the Python support package optional&lt;/a&gt;, at the discretion of the project template. This was needed because Chaquopy provides the Python library using a Gradle plugin, rather than requiring a project to source a pre-compiled support package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have addressed an issue with the way Briefcase handles &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/816"&gt;requirements references when they are relative file references&lt;/a&gt;. Although this was added to allow rapid debugging of changes to Toga on Android, it also affected the recently added Linuxdeploy backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/846"&gt;added an &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; subcommand to Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to open project-based templates in their respective IDEs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/821"&gt;improved Android log handling&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that more app-specific logs are displayed to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/844"&gt;dramatically improved our CI testing of Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;. We now build an app on every platform we support, using every backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've addressed a number of bugs in the Pack layout algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've continued the process of making Toga widget APIs naming internally consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've fixed some canvas bugs that were causing problems on Windowns with our native Matplotlib rendering backend, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga-chart"&gt;toga-chart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've addressed some bugs associated with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1572"&gt;changing the main content of a Toga window&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1574"&gt;initial implementation of a DetailedList widget on Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, we hope to wrap up the work on binary dependencies. On Android, this is mostly a matter of completing the work to support multiple Python versions. On iOS, we need to develop the tools to manage the compilation of third-party binary libraries. We have an initial proof of concept of this; we need to finish these tools, and develop the infrastructure to distribute. We're also hoping to start conversations with the Anaconda team about Conda integration with Briefcase, and start improving GUI testing in Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This month, our focus was on packaging improvements on Linux and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition the technical progress, we welcomed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mhsmith"&gt;Malcolm Smith (&amp;#64;mhsmith on Github)&lt;/a&gt; to the Anaconda BeeWare team! Malcolm brings his considerable experience developing and maintaining &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo"&gt;Chaquopy&lt;/a&gt;, a set of tools and libraries for building Android applications that use Python. Chaquopy tackles the &amp;quot;Python on Android&amp;quot; problem from the perspective of adding Python to an existing Android Studio project rather than writing apps entirely with Python; as a result, it features much tighter integration with native Android Studio tooling. One particularly interesting feature of Chaquopy is that it supports binary dependencies on Android - a key feature that BeeWare's Android tooling currently lacks. Historically, Chaquopy was a closed source tool with licenses available for open source projects; however, as a result of joining Anaconda, Malcolm has &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-is-now-open-source/"&gt;released Chaquopy as an Open Source project&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During July:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/756"&gt;added support for Linuxdeploy plugins&lt;/a&gt; for Linux AppImages. These plugins are an important part of making AppImages self-contained, as many libraries need to provide the Linuxdeploy tooling hints to help find all the resources needed at runtime. Adding support for these plugins should address most of the issues we've been seeing with moving AppImages between Linux versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/802"&gt;added a Flatpak backend for Linux packaging&lt;/a&gt;. Flatpak is an alternative packaging format to AppImage which has the support of a number of large Linux distributions. For now, AppImage continues to be the default Linux packaging format, but we may change this default in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/782"&gt;improved the packaging of Windows apps by adding a stub binary&lt;/a&gt;. We're still hunting some bugs in this stub binary, but when those are resolved, the Windows apps generated by Briefcase will present to the operating system with consistent app naming and icons. The stub binary also enables us to catch runtime problems with the app in a way that makes diagnosing app problems much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We presented a webinar about native application development. If you weren't able to attend the webinar live, a recording is available; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3766379/B50F020E006CF935D87609BF3E247ED7?partnerref=anaconda.com"&gt;register here to watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got an initial proof of concept of a Toga app running on Android using Chaquopy as a base, accessing a binary library (matplotlib), deployed with Briefcase. Over the coming weeks, we're hoping this proof of concept will evolve into major improvement to BeeWare's Android tooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified Briefcase to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/777"&gt;use OS-appropriate directories for caching&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;~/.briefcase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; location has served us well, it isn't a location that adheres to platform-native conventions for storing app resources, so we've moved Briefcase's cache of downloads, tools and templates to a platform-appropriate location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We addressed an issue with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/803"&gt;current working directory leaking into the runtime path&lt;/a&gt;. This was especially common with Linux apps, but it could potentially be an issue with other platforms as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've started the process of making Toga widget APIs internally consistent. While we've aimed to keep naming of widgets' attributes and handlers consistent, there are a couple of annoying inconsistencies. We've started the process of cleaning up these inconsistencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've started looking into binary dependencies on iOS apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, our major focus will be binary dependencies on mobile. This is one of the biggest missing pieces of the BeeWare story at present. Being able to utilize Chaquopy as a base gives us a huge head start on Android, so it seems likely we'll have a working solution for Android in the near future. However, on iOS, we're still at the &amp;quot;we don't know what we don't know&amp;quot; stage. It's unclear if we'll have a fully working solution by the end of the month, but we should have at least some progress to report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>June 2022 Status Update</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/june-2022-status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-07-04T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:393adcf6-a291-34ee-aafa-06fd4b016e4d</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been another busy month at the hive! This month, we've had a couple of high profile improvements, and some slow progress towards longer term goals. These improvements have been primarily in Briefcase and app packaging, but there have been some minor Toga improvements as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We significantly improved the UI of Briefcase by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/740"&gt;adding Rich&lt;/a&gt; to implement terminal output. This allows us to have &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/755"&gt;vastly improved progress bars&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ability to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/760"&gt;save a full debug log when a problem occurs&lt;/a&gt;.  These improvements (and several others) are the result of contributions from community member &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rmartin16"&gt;Russell Martin&lt;/a&gt; - thanks Russell!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/757"&gt;macOS app notarization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We improved the way the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/766"&gt;Briefcase manages Android system images&lt;/a&gt;. This corrects a bug we were seeing that was causing the Android emulator to be installed twice, and could lead to situations where emulators could be discovered, but not started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've explored the source of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/718"&gt;Linux packaging problems&lt;/a&gt; we've been seeing. We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/761"&gt;documented a workaround for one of those problems&lt;/a&gt;; and we're working on 2 fixes (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/756"&gt;supporting Linuxdeploy plugins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/754"&gt;adding Flatpak support&lt;/a&gt;) that will hopefully address the remaining Linux packaging issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/775"&gt;improved Windows MSI installers&lt;/a&gt; so that it will use the right &lt;cite&gt;Program Files&lt;/cite&gt; directory, as well as providing an install-time option for system vs user installs of a package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made some small improvements that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/769"&gt;improve support for non-ASCII project names and descriptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've made some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1504"&gt;more improvements to Toga Webviews&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that the current URL is accessible through the Python API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1514"&gt;addressed a long standing bug&lt;/a&gt; that would cause Toga apps to be unable to find their local resource folders, depending on how the app was invoked. More importantly, this change has been accompanied by additions to the test suite. This is the start of being able to test runtime behavior of apps, which will be an increasinging important feature moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1513"&gt;added a stack trace dialog for Windows&lt;/a&gt;. A version of this dialog will be integrated into future improvements in Windows packaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we published our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2022q3-roadmap/"&gt;Q3 roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, we'll be focussing on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completing the work on Linux and Windows application packaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presenting a webinar about native application development. If you'd like to attend, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3766379/B50F020E006CF935D87609BF3E247ED7?partnerref=anaconda.com"&gt;registration for this webinar is open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting investigations into binary module support on mobile platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also delighted to announce that we've successfully completed our hiring process; so, in 2 weeks, there will be another Bee in the hive! I'm very excited about the possibilities that this additional team member will afford. Look out for a welcome announcement in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>2022Q3 Roadmap</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/2022q3-roadmap/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-06-24T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:a63e754a-6c00-3735-9da8-551fb7320075</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of having the support of an organisation like Anaconda is that we are now in a position to make more concrete commitments on project goals, and the likely timeframe when key features will be delivered. To that end, in addition to monthly status updates, we're going to start publishing regular updates on our project roadmap so the community has a better idea what to expect over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project estimation is difficult at the best of times; and project estimation on a FLOSS project is especially complex. In addition to any work that we are planning internally as a team, we need to manage contributions from the community. If a community member contributes a piece of work that &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; on our roadmap, we need to review that work. As a result, our ability to deliver on our own roadmap is dependent on how much is contributed by the community - something that is very hard to predict ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, several of the topics listed on this roadmap are complex, foundational tasks, and potentially contain unknown complications. As with any complex work, it can be difficult to predict ahead of time how long that work will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q3-priorities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q3 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Q3, we're planning to work on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="linux-packaging"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux packaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breifcase's AppImage packaging backend has had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/718"&gt;a cluster of issues reported&lt;/a&gt; related to inclusion of third party libraries, and the post-processing that needs to be performed on an AppImage. We've already started work on this during Q2; early in Q3, you should expect to see this work wrapped up. This will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding support for linuxdeploy plugins for our existing AppImage backend; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a Flatpak backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="windows-packaging"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Windows packaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefcase has an MSI packaging backend for Windows; and while this backend works, it doesn't deliver an end-user experience that is as polished as we'd like. We should be starting initial work on Windows packaging in the coming week, with the complete solution completed in early Q3. This will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a stub binary for Windows apps, so that Briefcase apps present to the task manager with the apps name and icon, rather than &amp;quot;pythonw&amp;quot;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving log capture on Windows, so that it is easier to diagnose when problems occur; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixing some issues with the way the &lt;cite&gt;site&lt;/cite&gt; is defined and used. This may also address some issues we've seen with binary modules in some Windows apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="binary-modules"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Binary modules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest caveat on BeeWare's mobile app story has always been that we don't provide support for binary packages on mobile platforms. In Q3, we're going to start addressing this limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv"&gt;crossenv&lt;/a&gt; that can simplify this process, and we've got &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/647"&gt;a PR in our review queue&lt;/a&gt; that provides a proof-of-concept implementation of Android binary packaging. We need to take these tools, plus other tools in the Python ecosystem, and extend Briefcase so that we can present a clear development story for mobile developers that want to use modules with binary components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On iOS, there is an additional complication - we need to resolve how to manage dynamic loading of modules. BeeWare's iOS support currently relies on static compilation of all binary modules. This was originally done because prior to iOS8, dynamic linking was prohibited on iOS. The days of iOS8 are now long behind us; but the Apple support package has retained this old approach, mostly because it wasn't clear what approach Apple would allow through the App Store review process. We will be making changes to Briefcase's iOS support to accomodate dynamic module loading, and then extending that support to include user-provided binary modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="testing-especially-gui-testing"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing (especially GUI testing)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without testing, it's very difficult to ensure the stability and reliability of code in the long term. Unfortunately, many of the areas where BeeWare operates are inherently difficult to test. Visual GUI tests are notoriously difficult to perform; packaging tests require the ability to actually install and run finished applications; testing mobile applications requires access to mobile device hardware in a CI setup. As a project, we've avoided writing tests for many of our core features due to these complexities - and we've paid the price for this in regressions. Now that we have more time, we can focus on setting up the frameworks to let us perform this testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support package tests&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that the packages include valid libraries;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App template tests&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that Briefcase is able to generate valid and installable applications; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GUI tests&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that Toga generates apps that look and behave the way they should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing is an ongoing process, so it's highly unlikely we'll have &amp;quot;100% test coverage&amp;quot; by the end of the quarter. The goal will be to add the frameworks that allow us to add tests &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, so that we can retrofit tests onto existing code, and add tests on all new code going forward. Ideally, these tests will be fully automated tests running in CI. However, we may accept semi-automated or manual tests as a short term of interim measure, especially if those tests lay the groundwork for fully automated tests in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conda-integration"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conda integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefcase is currently uses PyPI and pip as source of Python packages. However, PyPI and pip isn't the only packaging solution in the Python ecosystem - another commonly used packaging source is Conda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I must recognise the elephant in the room - Anaconda, the company that produced and maintains Conda,  is my employer. However, I must stress that the fact this is on our roadmap is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as a result of a directive from my employer. The original &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/596"&gt;proposal for this idea&lt;/a&gt; predates even my earliest hiring discussions with Anaconda. It is being pursued now for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key value of Conda is that it simplifies the process of delivering complex binary packages, and ensuring that the binary dependencies for those packages are isolated from any packages that might be present on the user's computer. This core problem statement shares a lot of similarities with the core problem associated with application packaging. Conda also has much more nuanced representation of hardware platforms, alternatives for binary artefacts, and options for custom repositories. There is a possibility that using Conda as a packaging base may simplify some of the problems we've seen with distributing binary dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a significant portion of the Python community that have commercial needs that requires the use of the managed repositories provided by Anaconda, or are simply more familiar with Conda tooling than PyPI/pip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result of having 1 (soon to be 2) full time engineers, we now have the resources to explore complex changes that might not have otherwise been explored. We are exploring this idea because we now have the resources to do so; we were not provided those resources on the condition that we explore this idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't anticipate dropping support for pip, or for PyPI as a package source. We're looking at extending Briefcase to provide another commonly used and requested option for packaging, rather than replacing PyPI/pip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="longer-term-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Longer term goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond Q3, the big items on the horizon are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="upstreaming"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Upstreaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple and Android support packages maintained by BeeWare include a number of patches against the core CPython. We want to begin the process of getting these modifications into the CPython codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been two major impediments to this in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development resources&lt;/strong&gt; When we were a volunteer driven project, we didn't have the resources to engage meaningfully with the CPython core team to shepherd our patches into the CPython codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; Supported platforms in the CPython codebase need to have CI solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have resources, so we can dedicate the time needed to upstream patches; and once we've completed our testing work in Q3, we'll be in a position to recommend CI configurations to the CPython core team. That means the work of upstreaming patches and making iOS and Android fully supported platforms can begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="toga-1-0"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toga 1.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad goal for &amp;quot;Toga 1.0&amp;quot; could be considered &amp;quot;Tkinter, but with some additional bells to show off&amp;quot;. We want to deliver a core widget set of the &amp;quot;essentials&amp;quot;, plus some nice features to show off, like WebViews and camera or GPS integration. The exact set of features for Toga 1.0 is still a subject for discussion; I'd expect to see a more concrete feature list and plan emerge in Q4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most of the work that has been done in Q2, the foundational work we're planning for Q3 is not as glamorous as adding high profile GUI widgets, but it's all necessary work if we're going to provide a stable and reliable development story. Once this foundation is established, we'll be in a much better position to rapidly develop new features that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; visible - and to ensure that those features are stable and reliable as BeeWare develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>May 2022 Status Update</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/may-2022-status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-06-01T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:26a35eae-e73a-3108-939b-9e50b9b06937</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been another busy month at the hive! The progress we made in May isn't as obvious as last month - but the changes that have been made are an essential part of ensuring we have a stable foundation for future work on the BeeWare ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During May:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/145"&gt;We updated the Apple support packages&lt;/a&gt;. These updates aren't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a version bump - they also added support that enables the iOS emulator to run natively on M1 devices. This required a major restructure of the way the support packages are bundled, using Apple's new XCframework library packaging format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We addressed an issue with the use of ctypes on physical iOS devices. ctypes is a core part of the infrastructure we use to integrate with the iOS system libraries, so resolving this bug was critical for distributing apps. The fix was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/libffi/libffi/pull/718"&gt;deep in the core of libFFI&lt;/a&gt;, and has been submitted for integration into the upstream project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Android-support/pull/37"&gt;We released an Android support package for Python 3.10&lt;/a&gt;, as well as updated support packages for Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. These support packages dramatically are now dramatically smaller, and result in smaller end-user applications, thanks to some compiler flag optimisations suggested by the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We began the process of adding support for Python 3.11 to the Apple and Android support packages. This is the first time BeeWare has been able to contribute prerelease testing to the CPython project. In the process, we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92913"&gt;discovered a small backwards incompatibility&lt;/a&gt;. Baring major incidents, we should be in a position to release BeeWare's support for Python 3.11 on the same day as the official 3.11.0 is finalised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-support-testbed"&gt;We developed an acceptance test suite for the Apple and Android support packages&lt;/a&gt;. This test suite tests for features in the Python core that have a history of being broken (such as modules in the standard library that have binary components, but have been incorrectly compiled or inadvertently excluded from the build). This test suite isn't yet formally integrated into the build process, but the hope is that it will be in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modified Briefcase so that it is able to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/719"&gt;run the Android emulator on M1 hardware&lt;/a&gt;. This required a major rebuild of the way the Android SDK tooling is managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made further improvements to the log capture tools on macOS. This ensures that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/731"&gt;the first few seconds of application logs are reliably captured&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/742"&gt;log stream is terminated when the app exits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/744"&gt;We started the introduction of Black as a part of BeeWare's development tooling&lt;/a&gt;. BeeWare's repositories have always enforced code style guidelines, and those code styles are very closely aligned with Black's choices. With Black formally moving out of Beta status at the start of this year, the time has come to start adopting Black as a formal project requirement. For now, Briefcase is the only project that has formally adopted Black, but you can expect this to continue to roll out over the other projects in BeeWare over the coming months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We resolved some minor bugs that were present in the 0.3.0dev33 release of Toga. Most important of these was a bug that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1492"&gt;prevented the BeeWare tutorial running on iOS devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these changes either began as, or are entirely the work of community members. There are also plenty of smaller PRs, bug fixes, and bug reports that are just as important, but are too numerous to list. A huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to BeeWare during May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, we'll be focussing on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing our roadmap for Q3 and beyond! Now that we have reliable development resources, we're in a position to make public commitments on the future direction of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completing the hiring process for another engineer to work on BeeWare full time. This hiring process is underway, but it's not too late to apply if you're interested. Full details of the position &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521"&gt;can be found on Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Notarization on macOS. This is becoming an increasingly required part of macOS app publishing, as Apple cranks up their security requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving Windows packaging. This includes improving the way the running app presents to the Task Manager, improving log capture, and app signing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving Linux packaging. This includes addressing some issues with packaging binary dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Now Hiring!</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/now-hiring/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-05-09T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:59cca6f0-2c38-3023-812c-81976b099441</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;BeeWare is now hiring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position is a full time, Mid- to Senior position. You will be working full time in the Open Source group at Anaconda, on the BeeWare suite of tools. Full details of the position &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521"&gt;can be found on Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position calls for an unusual combination of skills. The ideal candidate would have experience building GUI applications (especially mobile) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Python skills. However, because of the existing state of the Python ecosystem, most Python developers don't have GUI development experience, and most GUI developers don't have extensive Python experience. For that reason, if the position is interesting to you, but you don't have all the &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot; attributes - &lt;em&gt;I would encourage you to apply anyway&lt;/em&gt;. A candidate with no GUI development experience will still considered, as long as they've got a demonstrated history of doing weird and wonderful things with Python. Similarly, a developer with deep GUI experience, but no Python experience, will also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job location requirements are also unusual. The position is remote; the position requires that your working hours need to be compatible with UTC+8. This means candidates from Australia, South East and South Asia will be a natural fit. European candidates will need to be prepared for early morning starts. US/Canadian candidates will need to be prepared for evening work (&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; late evenings if you're in CST or EST timezones). Anaconda has the capacity to hire in the UK, Germany, India, Australia, US, and Canada. If you're &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a resident of one of those countries, it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be possible to hire you, but it will likely require you to operate as a private contractor rather than a salaried employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm incredibly excited for what the future holds for BeeWare - if you'd like to come on this journey with me, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521"&gt;please apply&lt;/a&gt; (and tell them Russell sent you)!&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>April 2022 Status Update</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/april-2022-status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-05-02T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:0a8031ce-fb11-382e-81f5-5ee8fc7cb028</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of &lt;a class="reference external" href="../exciting-news-for-the-future-of-beeware"&gt;having the support of an organization like Anaconda&lt;/a&gt; is that we now have the time to perform little housekeeping tasks like publishing community updates. As a result, this is the first (of hopefully many) monthly updates letting you know what progress has been made in the BeeWare suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we've done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've cleared the backlog of pull requests and issue triage. At this point, the only PRs that are open are ones that require updates or changes from the submitters. A lot of stale or duplicated issues have also been closed or consolidated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1448"&gt;Webviews on Windows now use the EdgeChromium renderer, rather than the IE11 renderer&lt;/a&gt;. This massively improves the HTML compatibility of web views on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1461"&gt;Toga windows now use a &amp;quot;single source of truth&amp;quot; approach&lt;/a&gt;, using the API calls of the underlying GUI platform to determine the title, position and size of a window. This, in turn, allowed for the implementation of APIs that allow you to set the title, position and size of windows on desktop platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;on_exit&lt;/tt&gt; handlers on an App &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1463"&gt;can now be asynchronous co-routines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toga dialogs that return a result (such as YesNoDialog) now &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1464"&gt;use an asynchronous API&lt;/a&gt;. This is a backwards incompatible change that was required to support dialogs on Android; it also allows us to remove a nasty hack that was needed on iOS. However, we've been able to implement this in such a way that any existing usage that is incompatible with the new required usage will be flagged with a helpful error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1470"&gt;GTK web view has been improved&lt;/a&gt;, correcting some odd caching behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pyscript.net"&gt;announcement of PyScript at PyCon US 2022&lt;/a&gt;, we've been able to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1475"&gt;resurrect the Web backend for Toga&lt;/a&gt;. This is still in the very early stages - but it's sufficiently advanced that we can run the first 2 tutorials, in both a &amp;quot;server side rendering&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;single page app&amp;quot; format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/690"&gt;improved Briefcase's code signing integration on macOS&lt;/a&gt;. This should prevent some errors we've seen when signing apps that contain third-party binary modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've significantly improved validation and error handling when an app name contains &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/698"&gt;non-Latin characters&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/697"&gt;punctuation&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/617"&gt;reserved words&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've added CI checks to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/700"&gt;ensure that Briefcase is always able to generate a valid signed app bundles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/704"&gt;improved the output generated by verbose debug output&lt;/a&gt; to improve full environment details . This should make it easier to identify why a command is failing due to unexpected user environments, and to assist in manually reproducing Briefcase's behaviour outside Briefcase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now ensure that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/714"&gt;macOS apps are *always* signed&lt;/a&gt;. This is needed because &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; apps required at least ad-hoc signing to execute on M1 hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these PRs either began as, or are entirely the work of community members. There are also dozens of smaller PRs, bug fixes, and bug reports that are just as important, but are too numerous to list in a post like this. A huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to BeeWare during April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, we'll be focussing on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the support packages for macOS and iOS apps. Apple's transition to M1 hardware means there are new simulator architectures that require support; this, in turn, requires that we adopt Xcode's new XCFramework for the packaging libraries, which requires some fairly major changes to the way the support packages are built.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the support packages on Android to support Python 3.10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notarization on M1. This is becoming an increasingly required part of macOS app publishing, as Apple cranks up the security requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also expecting to start the hiring process in the coming month. We'll provide more details when we can point a full job description. If you think you'd like to make BeeWare your day job (or you know someone who might), now would be a good time to start polishing your resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Exciting news for the future of BeeWare</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/exciting-news-for-the-future-of-beeware/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2022-04-06T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:2715c7fa-31e0-3092-a26c-8a0326f23d5e</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge for any Open Source project is finding the resources needed to support development - and the BeeWare project is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, BeeWare has been primarily driven by the efforts of volunteers. We've been able to achieve amazing things with those volunteer efforts, demonstrating that Python is a viable language for GUI development on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as providing a proof-of-concept demonstration on Web. However, there are still lots of features that we'd like to add, and lots of ongoing maintenance that needs to be done as operating systems and hardware platforms evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we've been incredibly fortunate to have the financial support of our members. While I'm incredibly grateful for that support, it falls a long way short of even one full-time salary. We've also received grants (such as the PSF grant), and short-term contracts. These grants and contracts have enabled us to add specific (and much needed) features to BeeWare - but they don't provide resources for ongoing development and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the brutal truth is that our rate of progress is severely limited by the volunteered resources at our disposal. As a result, I've spent a lot of time over the last few years thinking about how we can fund the work that needs to be done to make BeeWare the go-to solution for GUI development on desktop, mobile, and more - and do so without compromising the Open Source roots of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm incredibly excited to announce that I've found a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 21, I joined Anaconda as a Principal Engineer and Team Lead - and the team I will be leading will be focused 100% on BeeWare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anaconda is no stranger to Open Source. In addition to indirectly funding a number of community efforts through their Anaconda Dividend program, they directly employ people to work on Numba, Dask, Pyston and more. BeeWare will be joining this stable of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anaconda is supporting BeeWare in this way because they see the potential for Python as a language for GUI development - especially on mobile platforms. Python has established itself as an incredibly popular language in education, science, business and more - and in all those markets, there is potential to develop apps. By adding mobile platform support and app development to the list of tasks to which Python is already incredibly capable, Anaconda hopes to ensure the long term prospects of Python as a language, as well as ensuring a healthy market for the products they sell commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeeWare will continue to be a 100% Open Source project, with all contributions welcome from the community. The only difference is that Anaconda will be directly employing some of the contributors to the project. The conversations I've had with Anaconda's engineering leadership indicates they are acutely aware of the tension that exists between corporate funding and the technical direction of an Open Source project. They've indicated that they want to ensure that BeeWare's technical direction remains independent in both appearance and substance. This includes financial independence - the financial support provided by our members will remain vitally important, as it provides project-level funding for resources such as hosting and promotional materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The related good news is that part of my job title is &amp;quot;Team Lead&amp;quot; - so in the very near future, we'll be looking for people to join me on my team. I'm already working out the details of the team that I'd like to have, so watch this space for hiring announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anaconda has a long history of understanding and contributing to both the Python ecosystem and the Open Source community. Adding BeeWare to their stable of supported projects has enormous potential for BeeWare, and the Python ecosystem as a whole. I'm incredibly excited for what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Some new ways to discuss BeeWare</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/some-new-ways-to-discuss-beeware/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2021-05-01T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:26e75a1e-7f81-398d-9af2-b7a7038aacb4</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, the BeeWare project is making 2 changes to the way we organize our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we're going to &lt;strong&gt;move our real-time chat community from Gitter to Discord&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we originally set up Gitter, it was a strong option for a chat community - especially one that was focussed on a software project, due to its tight integration with Github. However, over the years, Gitter has undergone multiple changes of ownership, but has remained essentially unchanged - in some cases, it's gotten appreciably worse (their native iOS and Android clients are effectively deprecated). In the meantime, Discord has emerged as a dominant player for community chat. It has a robust mobile client, and really good tools for community moderation, as well as the option of hosting video and voice chats - something we hope to be able to use for coordinating virtual sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To join the new BeeWare Discord server, &lt;a class="reference external" href="/bee/chat/"&gt;visit this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we're going to &lt;strong&gt;start using Github Discussions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, we've tried to use Github Issues as a pseudo-forum. There's a lot of similarity between how a forum works and how Github displays and manages issues. Each &amp;quot;issue&amp;quot; is effectively a forum thread, and each comment is a message in that thread. However, there are also some important differences. Issues get closed when they're resolved; forum threads, however, don't necessarily have a resolution. Most importantly, &amp;quot;closing&amp;quot; an issue can look like someone is trying to kill discussion - when all they're really trying to do is keep the list of issues manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Github has noticed the similarity too, and has launched Github Discussions. Discussions offers a familiar &amp;quot;forum&amp;quot; interface, but with the familiar Github message interface, and tight integration with Github Issues and pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've enabled Discussions on all the key BeeWare projects - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/discussions"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions"&gt;Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/discussions"&gt;Rubicon ObjC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-java/discussions"&gt;Rubicon Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum/discussions"&gt;Colosseum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/travertino/discussions"&gt;Travertino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/podium/discussions"&gt;Podium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, all of these new community spaces - along with all existing BeeWare spaces - are subject to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/community/behavior/"&gt;BeeWare Community Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope these two changes will make it easier to participate in the BeeWare community. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Release the Android Bees!</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/release-the-android-bees/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2020-07-06T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:cd296415-3dd2-310c-a6ca-01394bcf6b2e</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;9 months ago, we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/beeware-project-awarded-a-psf-education-grant/"&gt;announced that the BeeWare Project was the recipient of a PSF Education Grant&lt;/a&gt;. In late 2019, we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/we-have-a-contractor-for-our-android-contract/"&gt;choose Asheesh Laroia to do the work&lt;/a&gt;. Today, we're proud to announce that BeeWare's Android support has reached a point where it is ready for mass consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.beeware.org"&gt;The BeeWare tutorial&lt;/a&gt; has been updated to include an Android track. The tutorial walks you through the process of writing your first app, and deploying it - first as a desktop app, and then on your phone. All you need is a Python install; everything else you need is downloaded automatically by the BeeWare tools as part of the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to prove that it's real - we have uploaded Travel Tips to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keith_magee.traveltips"&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Python app, in the Google Play Store, deployed from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/traveltips"&gt;the same source code&lt;/a&gt; as the version in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/travel-tips/id1336372310#?platform=iphone"&gt;iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks go to Asheesh for all the work he's put into this project. Delivering Android support in BeeWare has required considerable technical skill, attention to detail, and creative hacks; and Asheesh has consistently delivered. Huge thanks also go to the Education Grants Committee of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for the faith they placed in BeeWare when they funded this project. In 6 months (while simultaneously negotiating a world pandemic), we've gone from a nothing to a full Android implementation. Without their financial support, this project would still be a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still plenty of work to be done, though. There are still a lot of widgets that need Android implementations, and new widgets that we want to add. We'd like to add support for device features like cameras, GPS and accelerometers. We'd like to make it easier to use binary Python packages like NumPy, Keras, and more. And we'd like to merge the work that we've done into CPython itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those are significant projects in themselves, and will require effort comparable to that required to add Android as a supported platform. And so, we're looking for the financial support to make that happen. We're applying for new grants as opportunities arise, but the most helpful source of funds are the ongoing funds that come from memberships. Ongoing funding means we can focus on improving BeeWare, rather than chasing grants. It means being able to hire &lt;em&gt;permanent&lt;/em&gt; staff, rather than offering short term contracts. And it means being able to make long term plans and promises to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this project proves anything, it's that money makes things happen. If you're excited by the prospects of Python on mobile platforms, please consider &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/contributing/membership/"&gt;joining the BeeWare Project as a financial member&lt;/a&gt;. Or, if you've got experience with commercialisation of Open Source projects, or any other ideas for how we could  &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:contact&amp;#64;beeware.org"&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've incredibly happy to announce that we've just hit our first major milestone: a working pure-Python application, running on an Android device!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="710" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2B2wbgVq7s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the end of the project - it's just the beginning. There's still lots of fine tuning to be done (especially on the size of the support libraries), and we need to integrate this support into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/"&gt;Briefcase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the meantime, if you're adventurous, you can take Asheesh's work-in-progress for a spin. His &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/paulproteus/Python-Android-support"&gt;Python Android Support repository&lt;/a&gt; contains the current state of the work, and includes fairly comprehensive instructions for getting started. You'll need to know at least a little bit about native Android programming to make full use of this repository at the moment; but if you want to replicate the results from the video, that repository (and the other repositories it links to) should have everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks go once again to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Without their financial support, this work would still be on the drawing board. This project is just one of many ways that the PSF uses donations to improve the Python community and ecosystem. If your company uses Python in any capacity, I &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; encourage you to contribute financially to the PSF so that they can continue to fund worthwhile projects like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks also go to Asheesh. Without his remarkable talents, attention to detail, and delight for obscure compiler errors, we wouldn't have made the incredibly fast progress that we've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more announcements soon!&lt;/p&gt;

At that time, we issued a call for contractors to help us complete this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very happy to announce that we've now selected a contractor: &lt;strong&gt;Asheesh Laroia&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asheesh is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pyvideo.org/speaker/asheesh-laroia.html"&gt;regular speaker at Python events&lt;/a&gt;, where he has delved into a range of detailed and complex topics. He also impressed us with the list of unconventional engineering integration projects he's been involved with in a professional and casual capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked why he applied to work with BeeWare on this contract, Asheesh said: &amp;quot;I use an Android phone every day, and I'm honored to be able to help implement the BeeWare vision of using Python to build first-class, native applications.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asheesh will be starting work in mid December, and if all goes well, we should start seeing significant results by mid to late February. If you'd like to keep track of progress, you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/pybeeware"&gt;follow BeeWare on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;; we'll also post larger updates on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

We have solid support for most desktop operating systems and iOS, but we know our Android support is lacking. The BeeWare core team knows what needs to be done to address the problem - what we’ve been missing are time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the PSF Education Grants group, that’s no longer an issue. We’ve been awarded a US$50,000 grant to bring BeeWare’s Android support to a level comparable with our iOS support. We currently don’t have the time to do the work ourselves, so we’re calling for contractors to help us deliver this support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paid contract, which we anticipate lasting 3-6 months (depending on the experience of the winning contractor). You don’t have to be based in the US or Europe, either; the opportunity is open to anyone who can meet the requirements of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the task calls for some sophisticated skills, and we’re not in a position to provide extensive mentoring. A successful bid is likely to require some prior experience, and a history with the technologies involved.&lt;/p&gt;

I've spent the summer working on optimizing the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/voc/"&gt;VOC compiler&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m super excited to share the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways to evaluate the performance improvement from my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="microbenchmarks"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microbenchmarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we introduced a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks.py"&gt;microbenchmarking suite&lt;/a&gt;. Each microbenchmark is a small piece
of Python code that tests a single and specific Python construct, or datatype, or control flow.
The benchmarking infrastructure itself is crude (essentially it just tells you the total amount
of processor time it took to run, with no fancy statistics) but it has been extremely useful to
me while working on performance features to verify performance gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the benchmarking suite is not to be run as part of the full test suite,
but rather as needed and manually whenever an optimization is implemented. It also provides a way to
check and prevent performance regression, especially on the &amp;quot;optimized&amp;quot; parts of VOC. While it
doesn't really make sense to record specific numbers, as they will always vary from machine to machine,
it should be reasonably easy to compare two versions of VOC. Benchmark numbers are included on each
optimization-related PR I've worked on this summer (see PR log below), and I hope that more benchmarks
will be added as more performance efforts are carried out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pystone"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pystone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/benchmarks/pystone.py"&gt;Pystone&lt;/a&gt; is a Python &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone"&gt;Dhrystone&lt;/a&gt;, a standard benchmark for testing the performance of Python on a machine.
Here are the before and after results on my machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things that I learned about VOC while working on this project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Object creation in the JVM is expensive. This definitely does not mean that the VOC user
writing Python should think about minimizing the number of objects that she creates, but rather
that any time we can non-trivially reduce the number of objects created during bytecode
transpilation or in VOC-defined function calls, we can expect to see a huge performance boost.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/825"&gt;Integer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/830"&gt;boolean preallocation&lt;/a&gt;, which is about reusing objects that have already been created,
was one of the most significant improvements we made this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Method calls in VOC are expensive. This is essentially due to the process of invoking a callable:
you have to check that the method is defined on the object, then construct it (read: object creation!),
and check the arguments, before it can actually be called. (This is done using reflection, which is super
interesting and confusing in itself.) And this is the reason why &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/875"&gt;refactoring the Python comparison functions&lt;/a&gt;
made such a big performance impact, because we were able to circumvent this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Exception-heavy code is expensive. Again, this is not to say that the programmer is on the hook for being
frugal when throwing exceptions, but that VOC benefits greatly by avoiding the use of exceptions internally
except when strictly necessary. For instance, Python uses StopIteration exceptions to signal the end of a for loop,
and they quickly rack up when you have nested loops (everything is ultimately related to object creation!). That was
the motivation for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/881"&gt;nested loops optimization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I may be a bit more reflective here, one of the a-ha! moments I had this summer was realizing that to really
optimize something, you have to understand where its biggest problems are first. I remember pitching to Russ at
the start of the summer things like loop unrolling, constant folding, even converting to SSA-form (you know, stuff I
heard about optimzation in my compilers class) and he was saying to me, think simpler. While working on my project,
I used a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html"&gt;profiler&lt;/a&gt; to understand exactly which parts of VOC were slow, and that information drove the changes we
implemented. I think it worked out pretty well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="future-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize boxing of primitive types like String and Int. As VOC is written half in Python, half in Java, a single integer can be found in various representations on its way through the compiler -- as a Python object, unboxed to a primitive Java int, then packaged back up to a Python object. This problem was (somewhat incoherently) addressed in my proposal, but ultimately we couldn't come up with a good abstraction to support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a peephole optimizer. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/peephole.c"&gt;CPython's peephole optimizer&lt;/a&gt; scans generated bytecode to identify sequences of bytecode that can be optimized, VOC could benefit from this too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hook up more benchmarks, which serve as both proof of the kinds of programs VOC can currently compile and areas ripe for performance improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thank-you"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will wrap this up by giving big thanks to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742"&gt;Russ&lt;/a&gt;, my mentor. The time you spent helping
me form my ideas, patiently answering my questions and reviewing my work was invaluable
to me. It couldn't have been easy keeping up with what I was doing especially since I
started improvising halfway through the summer. I am so grateful for your help, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

During the three months long coding period, I have contributed several patches in VOC repository of BeeWare, all working towards the ultimate end goal of running &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; module in VOC. In this blog post (which is my first actual blog post by the way 😄), I will document what I have done so far, why I couldn't make it to the end goal (yea, unfortunately I couldn't get &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; to work at the end of GSoC 2018), and what's left that needs to be done in order to achieve the end goal (or at least make part of &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="building-foundation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first error that the transpiler throws when attempting to compile &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; module was &amp;quot;No handler for &lt;cite&gt;YieldFrom&lt;/cite&gt;&amp;quot;, so it makes sense to start from this issue first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature related to generator was &lt;cite&gt;Yield&lt;/cite&gt; expression. Before GSoC 2018, &lt;cite&gt;Yield&lt;/cite&gt; statement in VOC was just a statement, meaning &lt;cite&gt;yield&lt;/cite&gt; could not be used as expression. Generator methods such as &lt;cite&gt;generator.send&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;generator.throw&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;generator.close&lt;/cite&gt; were not supported as well. Those features are what make asynchronous programming with generator possible, so I spent a few weeks to extend generator functionality in VOC, laying down the path to &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRs related to generator are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/821"&gt;PR #821&lt;/a&gt; : Added support for Yield from statement (merged)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/823"&gt;PR #823&lt;/a&gt; : Added generator send method (merged)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/831"&gt;PR #831&lt;/a&gt; : Support exceptions handling in generator (merged)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="nonlocal-statement"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nonlocal Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nonlocal&lt;/cite&gt; statement was another syntax not supported by VOC. After completion of generator's features, implementing this is the next step towards compiling &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing this feature took about 3 ~ 4 weeks as this is not as trivial as it seems. I took several approaches on this, while some of them do work, the code is not pretty and &lt;cite&gt;hacky&lt;/cite&gt;, which could come back to bite me/other contributors in the long run. After many discussions with Russell, I refactored the closure mechanism in VOC and took a much cleaner approach in &lt;cite&gt;nonlocal&lt;/cite&gt; implementations. I must admit that I took some short-cuts for the sake of &amp;quot;making nonlocal works&amp;quot; in the process of implementing &lt;cite&gt;nonlocal&lt;/cite&gt; statement, resulting in poor design and messy codes. Many thanks to Russell, who helped me to improve my coding style and told me not to be discouraged when I'm stuck. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-collections-module"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Collections Module&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next item on my hit list was pure Java implementations of the &lt;cite&gt;collections&lt;/cite&gt; module. &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; module depends on 3 data structures from &lt;cite&gt;collections&lt;/cite&gt;, namely &lt;cite&gt;defauldict&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Deque&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;OrderedDict&lt;/cite&gt;. Two of them (&lt;cite&gt;defaultdict&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Deque&lt;/cite&gt;) are implemented in C in CPython, plus they have good analog in Java, so it makes senses to implement the module in Java. Porting &lt;cite&gt;defauldict&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Deque&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;OrderedDict&lt;/cite&gt; to Java in VOC is relatively straight-forward, taking about 1.5 weeks to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Towards The Ultimate End Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, three months of GSoC coding period was not enough for me to bring &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; module to VOC. The nonlocal statement implementation was the biggest blocker for me mainly because I didn't think thoroughly before writing code. If I were to plan carefully and lay out a general coding direction, I would've completed it in much shorter time and have time for other implementations. An advice for the aspiring and upcoming GSoC-er, don't rush your code, make sure you know 100% about what you're doing before diving into the codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, following are the list of modules to be implemented/ported to Java before &lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; will work in VOC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;socket&lt;/cite&gt; module (a bit tricky since Java doesn't support Unix domain socket natively)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;selectors&lt;/cite&gt; module (high level I/O operations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;threading&lt;/cite&gt; module (might be easier to implement this first since threading in Python is an emulation of Java's Thread)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;cite&gt;time&lt;/cite&gt; module (partially implemented in VOC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="final-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to my mentor, Russell Keith-Magee for accepting my proposal, providing guidance and encouraging me when things didn't go as intended. It is truly an honor to be a part of the BeeWare community. I had a blast contributing to BeeWare project, and I'm sure I will stick around as a regular contributor.
Also shout out to the BeeWare community for answering my queries and reviewing my pull requests. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

If you'd like to receive regular updates about the BeeWare project, why not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="/community/keep-informed/"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're designing a GUI app - be it for desktop, mobile, or browser - one of the most fundamental tasks is describing how to lay widgets out the screen. Most widget toolkits will use a grid or box packing model of some kind to solve this problem. These models tend to be relatively easy to get started, but rapidly fall apart when you have complex layout needs - or when you have layouts that need to adapt to different screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of inventing a new grid or box model, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://toga.readthedocs.io"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; widget toolkit takes a different approach, using a well known scheme for laying out content: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"&gt;Cascading Style Sheets&lt;/a&gt;, or CSS. Although CSS is best known for specifying layout in web pages, there's nothing inherently web specific about it. At the end of the day, it's a system for describing the layout of a hierarchical collection of content nodes. However, to date, every implementation of CSS is bound to a browser, so the perception is that CSS is a browser-specific standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum"&gt;Colosseum&lt;/a&gt; comes in. Colosseum is a browser independent implementation of a CSS rendering engine. It takes a tree of content &amp;quot;nodes&amp;quot; - such as a DOM from a HTML document - an applies CSS styling instructions to layout those nodes as boxes on the screen. In the case of Toga, instead of laying out &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; elements, you lay out Box and Button objects. This allows you to specify incredibly complex, adaptive layouts for Toga applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Colosseum as a project has many other possible uses. It could be used anywhere that there is a need for describing layout &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; a browser context. For example, Colosseum could be the cornerstone of a HTML to PDF renderer that &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; require the involvement of a browser. It could also be used as a test harness and reference implementation for the CSS specification itself, providing a lightweight way to encode and test proposed changes to the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current implementation is based on Facebook's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; project - it was originally a line-for-line port of yoga's javascript codebase into Python. However, yoga only implements the Flexbox portion of the CSS3 specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we started a big project: rewriting Colosseum to be a fully standard-compliant CSS engine. The work so far can be found in the globe branch of the colosseum repository on Github. The first goal is CSS2.1 compliance, with an implementation of the traditional CSS box model and flow layout. Once we've got a reasonable implementation of that, we'll look to adding Grid and FlexBox layouts from the CSS3 specification set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a big job. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css-levels"&gt;CSS is a big specification&lt;/a&gt;, so there's a lot of work to be done - but that also means there's lots of places to contribute! Pick a paragraph of the CSS specification, build some test cases that demonstrate the cases described in that paragraph, and submit a patch implementing that behaviour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also highlights why your financial support is so important. While we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do this entirely with volunteered effort, we're going to make much faster progress if a small group of people could focus on this project full time. Financial support would allow up to significantly ramp up the development speed of Colosseum, and the rest of the BeeWare suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to see Colosseum and the rest of BeeWare develop to the point where it can be used for commercial applications, please consider supporting BeeWare financially. And if you have any leads for larger potential sources of funding, please &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:russell&amp;#64;keith-magee.com"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Every widget migration and every commit/PR/issue/discussion with my mentors about &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/rubicon/"&gt;rubicon-objc&lt;/a&gt; were detailed on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/issues/58"&gt;Issue 58&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="eating-your-own-dog-food"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;Eating your own dog food&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to show that a product is reliable to the customers is use it. So, the way to show that &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; is an effective tool to build a GUI is to build a complete application using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt; is a graphical tool that helps you run your test suites. Its current version is implemented using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html"&gt;Tkinter&lt;/a&gt; as the main GUI framework. So, why not test &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; inside of another product from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org"&gt;BeeWare&lt;/a&gt;? That's what I have acomplished during my GSoC work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal focus not only on the port of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html"&gt;Tkinter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;, but on mapping the necessary widgets for a real application using &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; framework. To help me to map this I studied more about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html"&gt;Tkinter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/colosseum/"&gt;Colosseum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/rubicon/"&gt;rubicon-objc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec"&gt;Objective-C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Cocoa.html"&gt;Cocoa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work I did during GSoC were sent throught the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/pull/65"&gt;PR 65&lt;/a&gt;, reported on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/issues/58"&gt;Issue 58&lt;/a&gt; and the final demonstration of the work can be seen in this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/5kz_CmQYFYE"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. There were widgets used on &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt; that weren't ready yet on &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;, so some improvements were necessary on &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; so that I could use them on &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt;. In summary here are some PRs and issues that I contributed to get my work done in &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closed issues that I didn't reported but I solved on &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some features on &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt; that I want to help develop in a near future, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A button to refresh all the tests tree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cricket settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there are some issues remained after this migration to &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;. These issues will be fixed on &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; widgets in a near future too, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A gap between the output and error boxes when there is no output message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a test if the user click on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt; will be the oficial framework on Python to build GUI for multiplatforms applications, so I'll continue to contribute to this project because I want to use in every application that I would need a GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="final-considerations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to truly thank my mentors &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742"&gt;Russell Keith-Magee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliasdorneles"&gt;Elias Dorneles&lt;/a&gt; for guide and help me so much during this period. The opportunity to be part of this community was a great honor to me, thank you so much to accept me in this program &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742"&gt;Russell Keith-Magee&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I want to thank &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/phildini"&gt;Philip James&lt;/a&gt; that made some reviews in my PRs and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ocupe"&gt;Jonas Schell&lt;/a&gt; that fixed one issue that I sent to &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/"&gt;Toga&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batavia is a part of BeeWare's collection of projects. As it is still in its early stage of development, for my part I offered to implement a number of features missing from Batavia, ranging from elemental data types, through JSON manipulation and language constructs such as generators. I posted my proposal in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/batavia/issues/483"&gt;this GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt; and kept it updated with my progress on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that by the end of GSoC, we have decided to diverge from the proposal and forgo implementation of &lt;cite&gt;contextlib&lt;/cite&gt; in favor of support for Python 3.6 2-byte wide opcodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was great learning experience and fun. Big thanks to my mentors Russell Keith-Magee and Katie McLaughlin, and the whole BeeWare community.&lt;/p&gt;

After three month of working on the BeeWare project, I would like to summarise my work and share my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="no-battle-plan-survives-first-contact"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“No Battle Plan Survives First Contact.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the first things Russell said to me after we decided to fundamentally restructure my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/118"&gt;proposed GSoC timetable and goals&lt;/a&gt;. During the community bounding period we discovered that Toga was even harder to test as we expected. The tight coupling between the platform independent Toga-Core part and the platform dependent implementations for (Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux, Android, Django, ...) was giving us a hard time to write meaningful tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect Toga to become a decently sized project, therefore we want it to have a solid and well tested base. Given that, we decided that I would spend most of GSoC to restructure Toga to make it more testable. Besides that, I would also add implementation tests to check if a given backend is implemented in the right way. If I would finish before the end of the summer I would just start with my original project proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-big-restructure-of-toga"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Big Restructure of Toga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new goals and a fresh branch I started the journey to restructure the Toga project to make it more testable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hacking around and testing different things on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ocupe/restruc_toga"&gt;separate branch&lt;/a&gt;. I identified that the intertwined platform dependencies are the main problem. To separate the Toga-Core module form its backend implementations we decided to use the factory pattern instead of the inheritance model that we had before. Now every backend has its own factory that produces the right widgets for the platform it is running on. This way we have a clear separation between Toga-Core and the implementation level. Platform dependencies are now enclosed in the implementation level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the new structure was clear I ported Toga-Core as well as the backends for cocoa, iOS and GTK. I did this in the Toga branch &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/185"&gt;(The Big Restructure of Toga [WIP] #185)&lt;/a&gt;.
In practice this meant that I had to manually touch almost every widget of all backends to port them to the new factory pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="challenges"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toga talks to native GUI frameworks, hence I had to get a good understanding about the principles and concepts behind each and every of these frameworks. At times I felt overwhelmed by the combined complexity of all the parts that make up Toga. The following is list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every Toga backend wraps around a existing and unique framework.  To wrap the framework you have to understand the framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I love Python, why do I have to understand Objective C”? To effectively work on the iOS and macOS backends I had to learn the basics of Objective C – if only to read the Apple docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toga has a lot of moving parts. There are backends, frameworks, libraries to talk to backends, libraries to perform the layout of the UI and more. I spend a good amount of time to understand all of these parts. The following is just a overview of newly acquired knowledge during GSoC:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc"&gt;Rubicon-ObjC&lt;/a&gt; to talk to the iOS and macOS backends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/colosseum/"&gt;Colosseum&lt;/a&gt; to understand and fix layout problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ast.html"&gt;AST&lt;/a&gt; module to perform the implementation tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of Design Patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to structure large projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and understand big and complex code chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-work-i-did"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other work I did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR: Translated part of the beeware.org webpage into german. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/173"&gt;(PR #173)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helped newcomers on Gitter and GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tested if Toga would profit from static typing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ocupe/toga/tree/static_typing"&gt;(toga/static_typing)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created an implementation test suite based on the AST module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added test for Toga-Core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated and extended documentation on Toga-Core as well as the macOS and iOS Backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a toga-dummy backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First draft of the Settings API and working backend implementation for macOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many small and big fixes on Toga-Core, cocoa, iOS, and GTK backends. All in the main PR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/185"&gt;beeware/toga The Big Restructure of Toga [WIP]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/171"&gt;beeware/toga fix for getting the length of the filenames array&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/193"&gt;beeware/toga Fixed #189 cocoa.progressbar with rehint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-template/pull/3"&gt;beeware/briefcase-template Fix for spaces in app name. Issue #2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/222"&gt;beeware/toga Toga Settings API [WIP]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="future-work-to-be-done"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Work to be Done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All my work sits in the PR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/185"&gt;“The Big Restructure of Toga [WIP]”&lt;/a&gt;. After the missing backends, namely Windows and Android, are ported, everything can be merged into master. We have to wait for the missing backends, because the new is incompatible with the old versions and they can’t coexist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Settings API from my original proposal is not finished because of the above mentioned reasons. I have a first working draft and I will continue working on it after GSoC in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/222"&gt;this PR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shoutout"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shoutout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Russell Keith-Magee for being an awesome Mentor and for all the time he invested in me during GSoC. I also would like to thank the BeeWare community for helping me when ever I had a problem. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

Learning how to write good tests helps you write more robust code, and ensures that when you've written code that works, it keeps working long into the future. It can also help you write better code in the first place. It turns out that well architected code, with high cohesion and low coupling, is also easy to test - so writing code that is easy to test will almost always result in better overall code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important step in &amp;quot;levelling up&amp;quot; your testing experience is to start using a Continuous Integration, or CI service. A CI service is a tool that automatically runs your test suite every time someone makes a change - or every time someone proposes a change in the form of a pull request. Using a CI service makes sure that your code &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; passes your test suite - you can't accidentally slip in a change that breaks a test, because you'll get a big red warning notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI is such an important service that many companies exist solely to provide CI-as-a-service. The BeeWare project has, for various projects, used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org"&gt;TravisCI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://circleci.com"&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;. Both these tools provide free tiers for open source projects, and have generously sponsored BeeWare with capacity upgrades at various times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the BeeWare has had an interesting relationship with commercial CI services. This is for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, our test suites - especially for &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/voc"&gt;VOC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/batavia"&gt;Batavia&lt;/a&gt; - take a long time to run. These two projects require tests that repeatedly start and shut down virtual machines (for Java and JavaScript, respectively), and no matter how much you optimize the code being tested, the startup and shutdown time of a virtual machine eventually adds up. We also need to run our test suites on multiple versions of Python - at present, we support Python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, with 3.7 on the horizon. There are also subtle changes in micro versions that may require testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been able to speed up the duration of a test run by splitting up the test suite and running parts of the suite in parallel, but that forces us up against the second problem. Commercial CI services usually operate on a subscription model; higher subscriptions providing more simultaneous resources. However, our usage pattern is highly unusual. Most of the year, we get a slow trickle of pull requests that require testing. However, a couple of times a year, we have a large sprint, and we have a flood of contributions over a short period of time. At PyCon US, we have had groups of 40 people submitting patches - and they all need their submissions tested by CI. And time is a factor - the sprints only last a couple of days, so a fast turnaround on testing is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to subscribe to the top tier subscription levels of CircleCi and TravisCI, we still wouldn't have enough resources to support a sprint - but we'd be &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; overresourced for the rest of the year. We'd also have to pay $750 or more a month for this service, which is a budget we can't afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - we had a problem. To run our test suite effectively, we needed massively parallelized resources to run a test suite quickly; and at certain times of the year, we need extremely large numbers of these resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had other automated tasks that we wanted to perform. We wanted to do code linting (automated checking of code style) before a PR was tested. We wanted to check spelling of documentation. And we wanted these tasks to feed back into GitHub as automated comments and specific code review status markers, informing contributors not just that a problem occurred - but what problem occurred, and where in their code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to manage pipeline builds - there's no point in doing a full test of multiple versions of Python once you've established the tests are failing on one version. And there's no point testing &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; if there are code style problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to do things that weren't just testing. We wanted to check that contributor agreements have been signed. We wanted to automate deployment of websites and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we had wasn't just a CI problem. It was a problem where we wanted to automatically run arbitrary code, in a safe way, in response to a GitHub event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to find a CI service that can meet our needs for over a year. But over the last year, a few thoughts started to congeal in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon provides a API (EC2) that allows you to spool up machines of varying complexity (up to 64 CPUs, with almost 500GB of RAM), and pay by the minute for that usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker provides the tools for configuring, launching, and running code in an isolated fashion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon also provides an API (ECS) to control the execution of Docker containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing specific about AWS EC2 or ECS either - you could just as easily use Linode and Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm, or Microsoft Azure... you just need to have the ability to easily spool up machines and run a Docker container. After all: a test suite is just a Docker container that runs a script that starts your test suite. A linting check is a Docker container that runs a script that lints your code. A contributor agreement check is a Docker container that checks the metadata associated with a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need then is a website that can receive GitHub event notifications, and start Docker containers in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of July, I found myself between jobs, and uttered the fateful question &amp;quot;How hard could it be?&amp;quot; And so, today, I'm announcing &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/beekeeper"&gt;BeeKeeper&lt;/a&gt; - BeeWare's own CI service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeeKeeper deploys as a Heroku website, written using Django. After configuring it with Github and AWS credentials, it listens for Github webhooks. When a Pull Request or Push is detected, BeeKeeper creates a build request; that build request inspects the code in the repository looking for a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;beekeeper.yml&lt;/tt&gt; configuration file. That configuration file describes the pipeline of tasks that will be performed, and for each task, the type of machine that should be used, any environment variables that are required, and the Docker image that will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeeKeeper also allows the site admin to describe what resources will be used to satisfy builds. A task can say it needs a &amp;quot;High CPU&amp;quot; instance; but the BeeKeeper instance can determine what &amp;quot;High CPU&amp;quot; means - is it 4 CPUs or 32? When those machines are spooled up, how long will they be allowed to sit idle before being shut down again? How many machines should be sitting in the pool permanently? And what is the upper limit on machines that will be started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A companion tool to BeeKeeper is &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/attic/waggle"&gt;Waggle&lt;/a&gt;. Waggle is a tool that prepares a local definition of a task so it can be used by BeeKeeper - it compiles the Docker image, and uploads it into ECS so that it can be referenced by tasks. (It's called &amp;quot;Waggle&amp;quot; because when worker bees discover a good source of nectar, they return to the hive and do a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance"&gt;waggle dance&lt;/a&gt; that tells other bees how to find that source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also provided a repository called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/comb"&gt;Comb&lt;/a&gt; (named after honey comb, the place bees store all the nectar they find) that defines the task configurations that a BeeKeeper instance can use. We've provided some simple definitions as part of the base Comb repository; each BeeKeeper deployment should have one of these repositories of it's own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a lot of work to do, but we're already using BeeKeeper to Batavia and VOC, and the upcoming PyCon AU sprints will be our first outing under high-load conditions. Some back-of-envelope calculations predict that for around $50, we'll be able to provide enough CPU resources for each test run to complete running in 10 minutes or less, supporting a sprint of dozens of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BeeKeeper was written to meet the needs of the BeeWare project, it's an open source tool available for anyone to use. If you'd like to take BeeKeeper for a spin, come along to the sprints, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beekeeper"&gt;check out the code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeeKeeper is also an example of the sort of product you'd see more of if BeeWare development was funded full time. I was able to build BeeKeeper because I had a spare couple of weeks between jobs. There is no end to the tools and libraries like BeeKeeper and Waggle that could be built to support the software development process - all that is missing is the resources needed to develop those tools. If you'd like to see more tools like BeeKeeper in the world, please consider &lt;a class="reference external" href="/contributing/membership/"&gt;joining the BeeWare project as a financial member&lt;/a&gt;. Every little bit helps, and if we can reach a critical mass of supporters, I'll be able to start working on BeeWare full time.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>A request for your help</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/a-request-for-your-help/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2017-04-05T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:977d485d-7829-3407-a020-c63603922d35</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Around 4 years ago, I made the first commit to &lt;a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt; - the first tool that would eventually become part of the BeeWare suite. Since then, the BeeWare project has grown to encompass support for mobile platforms, two alternate Python implementations, and a cross platform widget set - as well as the developer tools that started the project originally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of this time, BeeWare has been a volunteer effort. Initially, it was a solo project; however, over the last year in particular, the number of people who have contributed to BeeWare has grown rapidly. Over 300 people have now made contributions to the various BeeWare tools and libraries - due, at least in part, to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/contributing/challenge-coins/"&gt;Challenge Coins&lt;/a&gt; we've been offering at sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular note is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/community/team/"&gt;team of 7 people&lt;/a&gt; who have joined the project as apiarists, helping share the load of project maintainence. I can't thank these people enough - without their assistance, I wouldn't have made anywhere near as much progress over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that over the last few months, progress has been especially rapid. This is because, for the last six months, BeeWare development has been partially funded by very accomodating employers at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.jambonsw.com"&gt;Jambon Software&lt;/a&gt;. My contract with Jambon allowed me to spend significant periods of time being paid to work on BeeWare - and, not surprisingly, it was possible to make enormous progress as a result. The last 6 months has seen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive improvements to Batavia and VOC;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Android backend for Toga;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Django backend for Toga, enabling Toga apps to be deployed as web apps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Winforms backend for Toga, enabling Toga apps to run on Windows with a modern appearance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my contract with Jambon is coming to a close - which means my contributions to BeeWare will go back to being what my spare time allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means the rate of progress will also slow. There's still plenty to do: there's plenty of the Python standard library to port to Batavia and VOC; Toga needs much wider widget support; Colosseum needs to be extended so it supports the full CSS box model, not just CSS3 Flexbox; and the tools that started it all - Cricket, Bugjar, Duvet, and others - all need to be ported to Toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to be able to work on BeeWare full time. However, the simple reality is that unless I can find a way to pay for this work, it will only be able happen in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - this is an appeal to you - the Python community. If you are excited by the prospect of having access to Python on mobile platforms, or you would like to write applications in Python that have completely native user interfaces - &lt;strong&gt;I need your help&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For just &lt;strong&gt;US$10 a month&lt;/strong&gt; - you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="/contributing/membership/"&gt;join the BeeWare project as a member&lt;/a&gt;, and help make this dream become a reality. If I can find 1000 people in the Python community who want these these tools and are willing to support their development financially, I can start working on BeeWare full time. Of course, this target is even easier if companies get involved and sponsor at higher tiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can find &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than 1000 people, then even more becomes possible. The obvious option would be to hire other experienced developers to assist with the work. The idea of having others to bounce ideas off during the development process is very appealing. However, we can also use this as an opportunity to do some social good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, I've had an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/784545607402852352"&gt;open offer to mentor&lt;/a&gt; anyone who wants to get involved with Open Source contribution using the BeeWare project. However, not many people have been able to seriously take up this offer, because the time required to seriously take up the offer is prohibitive. I'd like to be able to extend my offer to more than just a casual mentoring relationship. I'd like to be able to hire - and pay - one or more junior developers for the BeeWare project, and focus on giving that opportunity to people from underrepresented demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for BeeWare. Financial support means faster progress. More widgets. Better documentation. More of everything you’ve seen so far from BeeWare. If I can find full time funding for myself - or better still, for myself and a small team - then I have no doubt that the BeeWare suite will become a viable alternative for commercial projects in very short order. Best of all, we will be able to do this without having to give up on the ideals of the open source movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited for what the future holds for BeeWare. I hope you'll join me on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if you’re contemplating signing up, and you’re coming to PyCon US in Portland this May, let me drop a gentle hint… sign up now. It will be worth it #cryptic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— PyBee (&amp;#64;PyBeeWare) January 30, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2017/"&gt;PyCon US 2017&lt;/a&gt; is running in Portland,
Oregon from May 17 - 25, and it's bound to be another amazing
conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org"&gt;BeeWare team&lt;/a&gt;
will be on site with a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/737043373953978368"&gt;booth in the Exhibit
Hall&lt;/a&gt;, along
with other Open Source projects from the Python world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this booth, we get two tickets to the conference. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access to the opening reception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 days of conference talks, expo hall / job fair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breakfasts, breaks, lunches, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swag bag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/freakboy3742"&gt;Russell&lt;/a&gt; and I have
already registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we want to give you the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;strong&gt;you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can get yourself to Portland on the conference days, we want to
give you our free ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we want in return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a little bit of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/community/team/"&gt;Bee Team&lt;/a&gt; will be helping to
staff our booth, but we'd also like to see (and give!) talks, so helping
us out by running the booth would be lovely. (Plus, and I'm sure Russell
would agree, just helping out on the booth earns you a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/contributing/challenge-coins/"&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, we'd love for you to stick around for the famous coding Sprints.
These are held in the four days after the event, while people are still
in town. We get coffee, lunch, and a room full of tables, chairs and
copious amount of power points, and we code on projects. We'll be
running a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/738400648614449152"&gt;BeeWare
sprint&lt;/a&gt;
where we will be mentoring and helping first time contributors earn
their shiny &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/738425474754314240"&gt;challenge
coin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like something you'd be interested in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:contact&amp;#64;beeware.org"&gt;email us!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell us about yourself! Who you are, what you do, why you want to go to
PyCon and what makes you interested in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to allocate our tickets early, so please email us &lt;strong&gt;by February
12, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>Money, Money, Money</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/money-money-money/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-12-10T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:583dbd7e-b3a5-3c9f-854e-50c690ef3dd5</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At PyCon AU 2015, and again at DjangoCon US 2015, I gave a talk entitled &amp;quot;Money Money Money: Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world&amp;quot;. The talk was a summary of the issues around one of the biggest problems that I see facing the open source community: how to provide the resources that are needed to develop and maintain the software that we, as a community depend upon. This means providing maintenance and support for established projects, large and small; but also providing an ecosystem where new ideas can be incubated, developed and matured until they present compelling alternatives or significant benefits over closed source offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been almost 18 months since I first presented this talk, but the issue persists. I haven't been alone in noticing and drawing attention to this issue, either. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nayafia"&gt;Nadia Eghbal&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned to write a white paper for the Ford Foundation entitled &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure"&gt;Roads and Bridges&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the chronic need for resources to support the basic infrastructure that underpins large parts of the modern economy. Eric Holscher (maintainer of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://readthedocs.com"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/"&gt;blogged about the problems he's had raising funds&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that the service he delivers is a widely used - arguably indispensible - part of the Python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite this attention, it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; doesn't get anywhere near as much attention as it should. And it's an issue that is of pressing importance to me, as the BeeWare project is looking for ways to fund the development needed to take us from &amp;quot;interesting technical demo&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;compelling technical solution&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back, it was suggested that I should publish a blog post to accompany the video presentation. I dragged my feet on doing this, until industrious BeeWare contributor and all-around nice guy &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eliasdorneles.github.io"&gt;Elias Dorneles&lt;/a&gt; offered to take my speakers notes and convert it into a transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - here it is. Money Money Money: Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world. If you've got any questions, disagreements, requests to present this at your conference, or just a generic offer of a bag of cash, you can reach me at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:russell&amp;#64;keith-magee.com"&gt;russell&amp;#64;keith-magee.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Russell Keith-Magee, if you've heard of me before, it's probably because of my work on the Django project; I've been a core team member for almost 10 years, and president of the Django Software Foundation since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big challenges of the Django project - and any big project for that matter - has been to secure certainty in its development future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day job is as CTO and co-founder of TradesCloud. We’re a Software as a Service for tradespeople -- plumbers, electricians, carpenters and the like. TradesCloud depends on a number of open source projects - Django, Apache, memcache, countless others. So I've got a business interest in the continuity of these open source projects - but I certainly don't have the resources to fund them &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also got a declared interest in GUI/UI issues, especially as they relate to development tools. I've got grand visions of what I'd &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do with this project, and I've received some great contributions from the community, but it's still largely my own work. But my startup would be able to make great use of these tools if they were mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also a maintainer of some smaller projects, like the Python wrapper to the Xero API. I started the project because I had an itch; and my itch has been scratched. But now I've open sourced that project, which means I've inherited a maintenance task. I've accepted help from a couple of people - most notably Matthew Schinkel and Aidan Lister, who have done great work. But if I'm honest, the maintenance burden of PyXero well exceeds the time I can reasonably dedicate to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - I've got vested interests in free software. I've got an interest as a producer of a successful project with a high profile; as the producer of a small project with lots of users but little personal incentive; and as a producer of smaller projects with almost no profile but grand plans. These projects all have different resourcing needs, reflecting their maturity as projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also got interests as a consumer of free software - both in terms of the software I rely on to develop my own projects, and in terms of my commercial interest in the long term maintenance of tools and platforms. I need these projects to continue to develop, survive and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience, I'd like to make a bold assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
Absent of any other constraints, given equivalent resources, the free software approach produces vastly superior engineering outcomes than the closed-source approach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is the operative clause &amp;quot;given equivalent resources&amp;quot;. Most free software projects aren't developed using anything close to &amp;quot;equivalent&amp;quot; resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, this is a blessing in disguise - regardless of the project, having scarce resources is an excellent crucible for burning away the unnecessary to leave only the base metal. But it's not always a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-moral-high-road-is-littered-with-the-corpses-of-our-allies"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The moral high road is littered with the corpses of our allies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to any prominent free software developer, and amongst the success stories, you'll also hear some consistent troubles - that they've got great ideas and grand plans, but no time to execute; that they're about to burn out due to the pressues of maintaining their project; or that they've had yet another mailing list discussion with someone who doesn't understand why you didn't drop everything to help them fix their problem. And there are plenty of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL is the software that drives pretty much every &amp;quot;secure&amp;quot; connection on the internet - and yet it took until the discovery of Heartbleed - a critical vulnerability that sent the internet into a tailspin - before it could find funding to pay for maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example - GnuPG - Werner Koch almost went bankrupt trying to support GPG - a project that many others depends upon for trust in their release process. He was rescued, at deaths door, by the Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are both examples that ended with funding; but it's not all happy endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the example of Capistrano. Hugely popular configuration management tool around 2007-8, maintained by Jamis Buck. In 2008, citing burnout and maintenance overhead, he famously withdrew support for Windows, saying &amp;quot;Windows may be the 800 pounds gorilla in the room, but it's not my gorilla, and it's not in my room&amp;quot;. This was an incredibly unpopular move; but even with that scale down, Jamis burned out in 2009, abandoning Capistrano, and a number of other projects, without maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;quot;Hi I&amp;#39;m an engineer at a well-funded company and we need this feature can someone implement it for free?&amp;quot; -- Every FOSS mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christophe (@Xof) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xof/status/622113231218192384"&gt;July 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is - that this is a community that has lots of cash. In the grand scheme of things, software development is a well funded industry. If companies can find money for foosball tables and meditative ball pits, they should be able to find resources to help maintain the software on which they've based their success. And if you're on the receiving end of the problem - a developer of free software - that can be really frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is the great unanswered question of the free software movement - how to reconcile the discrepancy between the clear demand for a software product, and the ability to convert that demand into the time and resources needed to service that demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="free-software-dream-vs-realty"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Free software: Dream vs Realty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the theory says that anyone can contribute to a free software project, in reality, every single project of any significance has leaders. At the most basic level, it's whoever has the commit bit. And you need that leadership, especially when anything to do with design is involved. The running gag is that a camel is a horse designed by committee. The worst APIs we deal with on a daily basis are the ones that were designed by committee. You need someone with taste running the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a bigger problem - there's the extent of the engagement that users have with a project. Here's a though experiment to prove my point. We're in a room full of Python users. Django is a free software project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who in this room has found a bug in Django, or has a niggling thing they'd like to see fixed Django API?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has turn that niggle into a bug report to Django?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has submitted a patch to Django for that niggle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of those, who have had that patch committed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;When this is done in front of a live audience, at each question, there are less people raising their hands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="products-vs-projects"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Products vs Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's going on here? Well, it reflects 2 different ways of looking at a piece of software - Projects and Products. And it's a matter of personal perspective - my project can be your product, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I view some code as a project, it's a body of code where I'm contributing to a larger goal. I'm willing to spend resources focussing on other people's needs in the hope that their needs will help make the project as a whole better. I'm willing to do this because I get some personal gain, like an enhanced public profile; or if the tool is really close to my work coalface; or where I know I can make a substantive contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the further I get away from my coalface, and the harder it is to make a contribution, the less inclined I am to even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to contribute to the project. Most of the time, it's a product that I'm using, warts and all. If a product has bugs, I'll work around them, or find an alternative, rather than navigating the contribution process and contributing a patch back upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a product, the freedoms afforded by Free software are a bit like freedom of speech - it's a freedom I definitely want, it's comforting to know it's there, but I don't spend every day making sure that I fully exploit the extents of those freedoms. There are people who do - protestors, advocates for controversial social positions - and one day, given the right circumstances, I might join in and help them. But most of the time, I just want to be pragmatic, and get on with living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dichotomy between the theory and practice is also the reason why comments like &amp;quot;Patches Welcome&amp;quot; get made in Free software mailing lists. On the one hand, it's completely correct. Anyone &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; contribute, and on most projects &lt;em&gt;patches&lt;/em&gt; are welcome. But most people don't look at a new open source project as an opportunity to engage and contribute. Most people just want to use the damn software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can argue it's because people are focussing on the wrong interpretation of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;, and haven't &amp;quot;captured the spirit of free software&amp;quot;. Which is 100% true, but utterly counterproductive as a position. Anyone who has done any UX work knows that if users are consistently making a mistake, blaming the user gets you nowhere. You were in charge of what the user experienced, and they made the &amp;quot;error&amp;quot; because of a fundamental cognitive disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if everyone &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get the right message - let's be realistic - it wouldn't work anyway. The mythical man month showed us that you don't deliver a project faster or better by throwing more people at it. 9 women can't make a baby in 1 month - a project doesn't just need resources - it needs the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; resources, in the right quantities. And ultimately, that means projects finding a way to get the resouces they need to be self sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that means that if we want free software to be maintained, and maintained well, we need to find a way to fund it's maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-value-vs-sale-value"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use value vs Sale value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 years ago, Eric S Raymond published an essay entitled &amp;quot;Cathedral and the Bazaar&amp;quot;. This essay catalyzed the start of the open source movement - a redefinition of &amp;quot;free software&amp;quot; to make it clear that the openness, not price, was the important property. What isn't as well remembered is that &amp;quot;Cathedral and the Bazaar&amp;quot; isn't the only essay Raymond wrote at that time. He published 2 other essays shortly after CatB - &amp;quot;Homesteading the Noosphere&amp;quot;, about the social organization and motivations behind free software projects, and The Magic Cauldron, about the &lt;em&gt;economics&lt;/em&gt; of Free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key distinctions that Raymond highlights in that essay is the difference between Use value and Sale value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale value of a product is its value as a salable commodity - literally, what you sell it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use value of a product is its economic value as a tool, as a productivity multiplier. This is how much economic benefit the user will get from the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important the is that the two aren't necessarily connected. In a traditional manufacturing environment, the focus is on sale value, because that's usually linked to the manufacturing cost - the cost of parts and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most software isn't produced for sale value - it's in house software produced for use value. In the case of free software, the &amp;quot;sale&amp;quot; value for free software is 0. But that doesn't mean there isn't use value, and the catch is to work out how to exploit the use value that exists within an organization as a monetization channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are your options?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you can sell merchandise. And while this is relatively easy to do, lets be honest - you're not going to fund a software empire selling t-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get users to pay for documentation. Write a book, get users to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the dirty little secret of the tech writing scene is that nobody gets rich writing tech books. They're incredibly valuable resources for the community, they're great for padding your resume, but not so great as a revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; pay well is selling training. Employers are willing to pay big bucks for training courses; if you can put together a 3 day intensive workshop, you can sell it over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can productize your offering. The source code remains free, but a simple, easy-to-use installer costs money. This works really great when when what you have is a clearly identifiable product - like an IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One specific model of productization is SaaS - give the code away for free, but pay for the convenience of having someone else administer it for you. Any open source web software is a good example of this - you can install the software on your own servers, but honestly, unless you've got a reason, you use someone elses hosted solution and let them take care of it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, SaaS is only viable if you can deliver &lt;em&gt;as a service&lt;/em&gt; - which means it's really only viable for web. And, as technologies like docker commodify deployment, it's possible that even this revenue stream might evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what else can you sell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can sell access to the developers. If you're the maintainer of a project, you're in the best position to provide support, or debug complex problems - which means you're in a prime position to sell support and consulting. &lt;cite&gt;Honza Král &amp;lt;https://twitter.com/honzakral&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt; from ElasticSearch calls this the &amp;quot;Ghostbusters&amp;quot; business model - &amp;quot;Who you gonna call?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can sell access to the software. Trolltech did this with Qt; Riverbank still does with the PyQt bindings. The library itself is GPL - but if you want to use it on a closed source project, you can, for a hefty fee. This has the advantage that it forces commercial interests to pay for what they're using; but it also discourages small scale commercial tinkering - if I'm writing a new tool, and I'm forced to choose between open sourcing my tool or a $1000 price tag, I'll probably choose a different toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also get into the business of providing certifications and guarantees - auditing code to ensure quality or compatibility, providing guarantees about fixing bugs, and certifying that individuals are skilled in the use of the product. This is a big part of RedHat's business model - auditing packages, making sure they all interoperate as expected, ensuring that security updates are available and meet the same standards, and certifying system administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a set of products that appeals to the &amp;quot;enterprise&amp;quot; high end of town - and that's is a lucrative end of the market. But those customers also tend to only want these guarantees for certain types of software - broadly speaking, &amp;quot;Boring fuddy-duddy&amp;quot; software. Your operating system, your database - these are pieces of software that need to be rock solid in an enterprise setting. Your debug toolbar - not so much, unless maybe they've being wrapped as part of a suite of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="undermining-your-value-proposition"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Undermining your value proposition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with many of these revenue sources is that if you run your project well, a lot of them are ruled out - or at least severely curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make something truly simple to use, you've just removed the need for books and training courses - or, at the very least, moved the ground to &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; courses - which are harder to write, and have a smaller audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django saw this first hand - Django's documentation was famously very good from a very early stage, and as a result, it was quite hard to get publishers to take on Django book projects - because the documentation was too good, and was undermining the market for books. It's taken a long time, and mostly self-publishing, to get good Django books available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a project mailing list, where the community answers questions for free, and it's a healthy, responsive mailing list... why would I pay for support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your software is well designed, and modular, and those interfaces are well documented, and I need a modification - why wouldn't I just write the mod myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Ok - I'm exaggerating. There are legitimate reasons to pay for support or to bring in a consultant even if the interfaces are clean and well documented. But my point is that the better you do a job as a free software engineer, it becomes harder to make the business case for your revenue stream, because the value proposition becomes less obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if it isn't directly undermining your value proposition, it can still undermine you indirectly, because the more time you spend earning money, the less you spend doing what the money pays for. Administering a certification program takes time. Writing and delivering training courses takes time. Consulting can be lucrative, but developing a sales pipeline takes time. And if you're consulting, you need to make sure that sales pipeline is full, which means you're going to err on the side of taking on more work than less... which means you've just closed the door on the the time you have available to work on open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need to be careful that in selling your business case, you don't undermine your main project. If every hard question on the mailing list is answered &amp;quot;We can answer that for a fee&amp;quot;, you're going to sound like a shill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a project says it needs money to make sure we stay on top of security issues... you have to be really careful how you say it, because the easy interpretation is &amp;quot;well, the project must be insecure, because they're not on top of security now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-question-of-scale"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A question of scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a question of scale. Python, Django - these are large projects with large communities. Making a business case for Python or Django isn't too hard. Not trivial, but possible. But is the maintainer of a smaller project - like, say Django Debug Toolbar - are they seriously expected to write and sell a book about Debug Toolbar? Or training and certification in its use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller projects are no less important to the vitality of the overall Django ecosystem, but those projects aren't afforded the same opportunties for fundraising as larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also important to realize that not all products are afforded all these opportunities for revenue. An IDE can be productized; a developer library probably can't. Different projects will need different mixes of revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="do-you-have-to-sell-something"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do you have to sell something?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok - but can we do this without selling anything at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;quot;How to make money from open source&amp;quot; is like &amp;quot;How to make money from clean water&amp;quot; or public education or science.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Pieter Hintjens (@hintjens) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hintjens/status/603446810183610368"&gt;May 27, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free software stems from a moral imperative - so can we fund development through altruism and patronage? Well, it's harder, but there's evidence that it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="crowdfunding-and-bug-bounties"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Crowdfunding and Bug Bounties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option that has seen a lot of activity recently is crowdfunding. Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide a way to a group of people to pitch in and contribute to a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Django community has a couple of examples of very successful crowdfunding projects, each raising tens of thousands of dollars (Django Migrations, Multiple Template engines, django.contrib.postgres, Django Rest Framework). But - if you survey the people who did these projects, they didn't make money on these projects. The amount of engineering time that went into them well exceeded the money raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea that gets floated regularly is the idea of bug bounties - placing a price on specific bugs. This is really just another form of crowdfunding - You want a specific bug fixied or feature added? Contribute money. You &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want it - contribute more. And eventually someone will take the bait and fix the bug or implement the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an attractive model - but it also has problems - most notably, Who gets paid. Do you pay by lines of code written? That ignores the contribution of reviewers. How much more important than writing code is reviewing code or triaging a bug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the biggest problem I see with crowdfunding approaches is that they are in conflict with establishing a working income. If you're hiring yourself out, the shorter the engagement, the higher your hourly rate. This is a hedge against unemployment at the end of the contract. If you're doing a Kickstarter, you're best served by having a small, clearly described, clearly achievable goal. So - a month or two of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means you need to charge your short term rate in order to guarantee long term income. But it's also in your interest to have a low fundraising target, so that the campaign actually tips. If it's too high, it could scare off potential bidders. It also means the community pays a premium for any new feature, which isn't the best use of already scarce community resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="grants-fellowships-patreon"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Grants, Fellowships, Patreon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok - so if you want longer term income, you need to look at longer term engagements. That means that you stop looking at funding specific projects, and start looking at funding the person, with grants and fellowship positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm including Patreon in that list because it's effectively &amp;quot;crowdsourced patronage&amp;quot;. You're not paying for a specific thing - it's &amp;quot;keep doing what you're doing&amp;quot; money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 months, Django has been using this model. We hired a fellow at the end of last year. The fellow - whose name is Tim Graham - is responsible for keeping the project wheels greased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, this has been a roaring success. Tim's made great inroads into our ticket backlog, and response times on ticket reviews are lower than they've ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part has been raising the money to pay him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a fundraiser at the start of the year specifically to fund the Fellow; that campaign has raised just over $50k US. That's no small chunk of change - but it's also not a lot when you're talking about a full time employee. We're going to need to do another fundraiser really soon if the Fellowship is going to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone agrees it's been money well spent, but converting that into donations has been hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="corporate-sponsorship"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Corporate sponsorship&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another other approach for raising money is to embrace the devil, and go commercial. Commercial interests have the money, so why shouldn't they pay for it? This can be very successful under certain circumstances - but you have to be able to make a business case for the corporate owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is a great example of this. Why are Rackspace, HP, Redhat, Ubuntu all interested in OpenStack? Because they sell products that benefit from commodifying the hosting environment. By making it cheap and easy to control cloud deployments, they increase the size of the market for cloud hosting, which means more money for their core business - either directly (like Rackspace), or indirectly (like RedHat, because cloud servers still need operating systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js is funded by Joyent for similar reasons - Joyent is making a long play that if it's easier to develop web software, more people will write web software, increasing the market for Joyent's services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Node.js is also a cautionary tale about corporate interests - what happens when the community and the corporate sponsor disagree about the direction of the project? Well, you get project splits, like the io.js split. Corporate money can corrupt. You need to be careful that project governance is independent of the funding source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a single corporate master also puts the project the risk if that corporate master loses interest. Django was originally under the wing of the World Company. Eventually, that interest waned, and the corporate support dried up, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="venture-funding"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Venture funding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other corporate answer that gets floated is to go get venture money. And there are some examples out there of people doing this. Meteor, for example, is funding their development with money from a venture fund. They've got plenty of money to hire engineers, designers - whatever they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes me nervous about this model? We've been here before. Who here remembers Eazel? For those who don't remember, In the late 90s, Eazel was a dot-com company founded to develop the Nautilus file manager. And, we got 2 years of open source code. And then the bubble burst, and the company went bust. Now, the good thing is that we still have the code. But it would be better to have the code still being actively developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="developing-a-patronage-culture"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developing a patronage culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, all this discussion is happening in an industry where billion dollar valuations are kicking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large parts of our industry, are built on a foundation of FOSS - but those with the most capacity to contribute, in many cases, aren't contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are - there are some companies that do give huge amounts back to open source communities. But there are also a lot of companies that don't give back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even those that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; give back - many of them give the help they're able to give, which isn't necessarily the help that is needed. The Django Software Foundation regularly receives offers for free or subsidized hosting from hosting providers. And don't get me wrong - that's great, and incredibly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what we really need is someone on the payroll to review bugs. Earlier on in the lifecycle of Django, we needed people to write new big features. We're in a constant need of graphic designers, artists, tech writers. We need people who know how to do sysadmin, and community outreach. And we don't need 400 people donating 1 hour; we need 10 very specific people donating 40 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a disaster hits, organizations like the Red Cross call for donations. And they will usually say &amp;quot;please give us money, not tins of food or blankets&amp;quot;. The reason? Money can buy what is needed. You can't control what people donate, and even if they do happen to donate exactly what you need, there's a huge logistic task of working out what has been donated, and getting it where it's needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSS projects are much the same - they require resources. Some companies donate in kind, and that's great, but it's rarely what is needed, and it's easy to get distracted working out what to do with all resources that have been donated, but you don't have an immediate use for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sadly, just as with charities - many companies don't donate at all. And I'm not claiming these companies are being deliberately malicious in not funding open source - if anything, we as a community have failed them because we haven't helped them help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we don't have a mechanism in place to make it easy to spend money, and easy to receive money. The current state of affairs clearly demonstrates that it's not enough that there is a lot of money in a community - you have to make the mechanism for donating that money as obvious and seamless as possible, and you have to have someone to direct that money towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One model community that I think does this really well is the Wordpress community. Wordpress is GPL'd software. There are books, videos, blogs on how to write wordpress plugins and themes - the same as there would be for any open source software community. But criticially, there are also books, videos and blogs on how to make a &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; writing Wordpress plugins and themes. Wordpress is GPL. And therefore, so are all the plugins. They've got a store where you can buy plugins (and get free ones), and easily install them in your Wordpress instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wordpress ecosystem has fundamentally embraced the fact that money needs to be part of the equation, and by doing so, they've created an industry that is self-funding - and this, I'd argue, is one big reason for the success of Wordpress as a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-controversial-proposal"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A controversial proposal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that vein, I'd like to make a controversial proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi"&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; was a revenue stream? What if, when I registered an application with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi"&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt;, I could specify a price - either per install, or per version, or per-app, or per-month. When I &lt;cite&gt;pip install&lt;/cite&gt;, the cost just gets added to my PyPI account, and I get a monthly charge on my credit card; and that gets passed back to the developer projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If PyPI stats are to be believed, Django is downloaded from PyPI more than 1 million times per month. If there was a 10c toll on each download, that would raise $100,000 per month - enough to pay for 10 full-time well paid developers, or a metric buttload of diversity, outreach, DjangoGirls, and community support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also leverage PyPi dependency information to pay it forward - if you're writing a project that depends on another, you could opt to pass some of your revenue upstream. Or, request that downstreams provide a tithe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's the biggest dependencies of all - PyPI and Python itself. If PyPI took a small cut of the revenue raised, that could help pay for the development and maintenance of PyPI - and potentially Python as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also take some of the money collected and put it into a development pool - so if there's a new project that needs some bootstrapping cash to get started, or an established project that needs some help for a big task (like a Python 3 upgrade), the community as a whole can easily funnel money towards that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about people who don't have money? Well, we can offer free passes. You're at a DjangoGirls event? Use this promo code to get free access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still give away your software at no cost. And it's still free software - you're still delivering Python, so you're still going to get the source. You could probably even make the signing up process completely optional. All we'd be doing is paving the cowpath - making it easy to collect a toll on the easy way to use your software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to say that any of this would be easy to implement. Completely aside from any technical challenge and nailing down details, it's a big philosophical change for the community, and that's a much bigger issue. But this philosophical question about money is a discussion that we, as a community need to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we've got here is a tragedy of the commons. Everyone agrees this software is good. Everyone knows that software needs to be maintained. But why should one individual company take on the economic burden of funding maintenance when their competitors are getting the benefit for free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="learn-from-the-mpaa-and-riaa-make-it-easy-to-do-the-right-thing"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn from the MPAA and RIAA: Make it easy to do the right thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the key lesson from the music and movie industry from the last 20 years is that if you make it easy to do the right thing, people will do the right thing. If you make it simple and seamless for a large company to swipe their credit card and get charged $100 a month for using all this open source software that has been developed, they will. Yes, people will cheat. Don't worry about it, as long as cheating isn't easier than doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason that this isn't happening right now is that it isn't obvious what the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; thing is. I could donate to the DSF or PSF... but it's a bit fiddly to organize, and it's not clear where the money goes... I could sign up to a few Patreons, or sign up to a bug bounty program... but not everybody is there, and those that are aren't really earning enough to make a living, and I don't want to just contribute beer money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we to do? The short answer is &amp;quot;I don't know&amp;quot;. There probably isn't going to be a silver bullet. I'd like to think that a monetization channel on PyPI would work, but I'll be the first to admit that it might not be the answer, or there might be problems I haven't forseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I firmly believe this conversation about money is conversation we have to have. Free software as a movement is over 30 years old. Open source is almost 20. We've conquered the technical hurdles. We're even conquered the policy hurdles. Now it's time to tackle how we make this a long term sustainable industry, not just commercial interests exploiting the naïveté of a stream of doe-eyed volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually going to take another slightly controversial position, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take questions at this point, for two reasons - firstly, because this sort of talk is a magnet for &amp;quot;I have a comment, not a question&amp;quot; responses; but also because this isn't a subject where I have the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a discussion we need to have as a community - and I'm eager to have that discussion - just not on this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>Hello Website</title><link href="http://beeware.org/news/buzz/hello-website/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-07-04T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Russell Keith-Magee</name></author><id>urn:uuid:d82f6a77-b110-3a4b-a058-1a3cd18cd77f</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the BeeWare project's new website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original BeeWare website was written a couple of years ago, when BeeWare was still a highly experimental project. The old website was a single page affair, with individual projects maintaining their own web identity. Over time, the number of contributors has grown, the number of subprojects has grown, and the number of core team members has tripled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the BeeWare project grew in complexity, the old website was no longer keeping up with the needs of the project, so the core team took some time out from working on BeeWare itself, and rewrote the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new website uses &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.getlektor.com"&gt;Lektor&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator tool written by well known Pythonista &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/"&gt;Armin Ronacher&lt;/a&gt;. This allows us to continue hosting the website using Github Pages, but gives us the flexibility to define a light database for the many types of content we need to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we're launching the site today, it's not complete. There's still content that needs to be written, and styling that needs to be fixed. However, we think that the new site is better than the old one, and therefore it's not worth delaying the launch any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also gives you - the BeeWare community - a great opportunity to contribute. If you find something that is missing from the site, or something that you think could be expressed better, or designed better, the entire site is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/tree/lektor"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Fork the repository, make the change you think that is needed, and submit a pull request (against the &lt;cite&gt;Lektor&lt;/cite&gt; branch - not &lt;cite&gt;master&lt;/cite&gt;). All contributions are welcome, and as with all BeeWare contributions, website contributions make the submitter all eligible to receive an exclusive &lt;a class="reference external" href="/contributing/challenge-coins/"&gt;BeeWare Challenge Coin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the new site; if you've got any feedback, let us know &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/issues/"&gt;with a ticket&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="/bee/chat"&gt;on our Discord server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote up some of his thoughts about the process in his article &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.wordfugue.com/tips-becoming-core-contributor/"&gt;Tips for Becoming a Core Contributor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie McLaughlin, who got her commit bit at DjangoCon Europe 2016, followed up with a post of her own, describing her path to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/06/08/on-becoming-a-core-contributor.html"&gt;becoming a core contributor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who aspire to become contributors to open source projects, it's helpful to hear how others got there.&lt;/p&gt;
